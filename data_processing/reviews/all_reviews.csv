ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Overall great place for a date or special occasion, but food leaves something to be desired.

The atmosphere is quite pleasant. You arrive by boat and enter the restaurant through another restaurant. All the tables and chairs are adorned with nice LED lights, enhancing the ambiance. We ordered one of the set menus. The salad was definitely the highlight of the meal. The soup was pretty good, but the two main courses left something to be desired. The pasta noodles were enjoyable, but the sauce was overly strong, and the shrimp was overcooked. We also had the duck, which had good flavor but was far too dry. The scallop was quite good—I really enjoyed its texture; it wasn’t soft but had a pleasant chewiness. The steak was decent with good flavor, though it was too chewy. The grits served with the steak were interesting, somewhat like a localized version of grits. The best part of the steak dish was the roasted garlic—it was some of the best I’ve ever had. Its consistency was perfect, and the flavor wasn’t overpowering; I could’ve eaten the whole bulb myself. For dessert, we had the cheesecake and molten lava cake. The molten lava cake was just okay and not very molten—it would’ve been much better with vanilla ice cream on the side. The so-called New York-style cheesecake was neither New York-style, nor cheesecake, nor even a cake. It was more like a cookie crumble topped with sweet cream and a layer of pistachios or nuts. The taste was decent, but if you’re expecting cheesecake, it’s nowhere close. It should be renamed to something else. We were also given a call server button to request service, but it didn’t work at all. When we pointed this out, they didn’t bother replacing it."
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Great restaurant with a nice atmosphere.
The staff of very professional.
Ask for photos and you get a real Art Director taking amazing photo to remember the night"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Highly recommended, we celebrate my GF birthday tonight here and we will come back again"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Absolutely love the vibes here! The food is outstanding, and the service is top-notch. Thái is an amazing server, and Trung takes the best photos. Can’t wait to come back!"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Booked a table for two for our 1 year anniversary. The food was exquisite. Even though the menu was unique, I could tell the chef maintained the taste of Vietnam. Definitely worth the experience."
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,This place is a gem of Q7.  A romantic place to take your partner to.   Food are really tasty.  Staffs are very friendly.  Will come back soon
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"We had a very disappointing experience at Mars Venus. Even though we had a table reserved for 5:00 PM, the kitchen didn’t open until 5:30. The décor was extremely tacky, the tablecloths were dirty, and the chairs were wobbly and rusty. The food quality was very poor. We ordered steak, but it was cooked terribly – dry on the outside and raw inside. Definitely not medium as requested.
The service was just okay. We were greeted when we arrived, but when leaving, none of the staff said goodbye, even though they were standing at the entrance. We’re not sure if this was because we gave honest feedback about the food.
Overall, a very bad experience. We cannot understand how this restaurant has so many positive reviews. We will not be coming back."
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Best place I ever come. Nice staff, friendly, so sweet place .. seriously service excellence
Foods so delicious and decoration 10/10.
-Highly recommended."
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Great atmosphere, average food.

The setting is beautiful—arriving by boat and dining under soft LED lights creates a romantic vibe. The salad and scallop were standouts, but most mains were underwhelming. The duck was dry, the shrimp overcooked, and the cheesecake wasn’t really cheesecake. Service button didn’t work and wasn’t fixed. Nice place for a special occasion, but the food could be better."
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,I set up a birthday party with my lover. They prepared it so nicely. The food and service are great at a reasonable price. But the way from the park to the restaurant is dark and easy to swipe for a women who wear high heels.
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"The food and service were great, our server  Quang Trung was very friendly. Only thing Google maps says the wrong pick up location. You need to go to the d7 marina to get a boat here."
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"1. Look at the reviews all 5 Stars usually comes from some gift!  But here are totally dumbfounded..... Waiters asked for 5 Stars just standing beside you until you did it!!
2. I really wants to tell the truth...the food just under normal, seafood lobster unfresh smell , beer stake dry and over cooked
3. The environment decoration need to be paid extra Reusable templates!"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Went to Mars Venus for birthday celebration. Waiters are very friendly and polite, well dedicated service. Delicious food with reasonable prices, amazing atmospheres, definitely return again in next time!"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,Very attentive service and good quality food. The only reason I dropped a star was because the courses came out rushed so that we were still eating one course when the next course was served. Overall I would recommend.
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,Good experience with this kind of romantic restaurant. Next time will come again
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Good service, decent Western food, romantic and private atmosphere. Awesome and attentive staff despite
unusually crowded night. However, it was quite hot outside. The restaurant should personalize the sign with the name of the guests instead of using the same “happy birthday” “happy anniversary” signs for everyone. The restroom was dirty though."
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Wow the service is amazing, they even gave a service request button that we didn't even need to use. Had a birthday dinner here, and they set up everything for you by request. Pictures, cakes, and flowers upon booking request. The setting and atmosphere is nice!"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,Romantic spot. Food was well presented and prepared. Service and atmosphere were highlights of the evening. Better after sunset.
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"I went here with my date and it was fantastic, the view and food here are so nice, especially the beef with had been cooked well. Delicious! Thank you!"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Amazing night with my love here.
Thanks Mr An and Mr Trung who supported us 💞"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Wow! If you are in district 7 you must go here. What an atmosphere, kind staff, good food and a beautiful place. Very romantic. Remember you must take the boat over, it is free. The restaurant shows on the opposite side of the river on google maps. If you are thinking of proposing to your loved one - this is the place. Also to dine for birthday or anniversary. Tried the signature 4 courses with soft crab and soup, salad with beef, snails and Ribeye. So tasty! The redwine was good as well. They will also give you a small photoshoot if you are interested at the table. Will come back! Thank you all"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"The food very delicious and the price is good , The general experience here is wonderful. The service is very professional, and the staff is very friendly. It’s the 2nd I went here and I’ll come next time again"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"fantastic place! best restaurant for romantic dinner nights! you will have to take a little boat from the saigon marina to get there but worth it. the food is good, but it’s definitely a place for a couples night. if you want to take cute photos like we did just ask Hao, the waiter will help you! 🥰"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Great atmosphere for your event, the service is flawless and the food was a good experience !

Be sure to check the website to know where to park, a boat will take you the the restaurant location."
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"should not try, below avrg quality of the basic food's taste about FRESH. Bring 1 mil vnd to another place and try buffet instead plz ! many other options"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,Great experience with my favorite person 🥰
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Steak didn’t cook right. But they took two wine glass off the bill and brought two pudding dessert as a apology. Good value if you can do some few things well. The snail served is totally different than photo in the menu. Staff came asked if he can take it back and cook some more. So food gone cold by serving in the table, few minutes later cook again makes the snail chewy…. Kitchen staff should study. Inconsistent wine glass size. 🙀🤷‍♂️Stingy pour. Remember one bottle has five glasses… They pour like 1/7. I asked for rib eye steak and later came back and told me they don’t have it. Kitchen should inform staff if something in the menu is not available… also super basic knowledge and communication. Chuck eye mid-rare came as a Rare…. Chef don’t know how to cook steak. Buy a thermostat for cooking and check the temperature of the meat inside before serving. It’s super basic, Easy and cheap. Waiter Staff is super nice polite and courteous. Kitchen needs to step up their performance.  It’s a outdoor restaurant."
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,The food and service are very well. I will come back next time.
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Very romantic & intimate setting. Food was ok, servers were great & professional, they even take photos for you & direct you how to get the best shot. Only way to get there is by boat, which is free & they come every 10 mins or so. Highly recommend for a romantic night with your significant other!"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,It was a great experience when we are here to celebrate our anniversary. The staffs are very friendly and supportive. The food is good. We are happy with the service.
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,So great
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,Great food and amazing service
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"The staff are super attentive, friendly and hospitable. The food is 8/10, tastes good but just slightly warm when served. We were sitting right at the river bank, so the table is a bit small and narrow but those on the other side look more spacious. Coming here for our  anniversary, they are willing to help us set up the table with candles, bouquet and our lovely polaroids. Will come back, 9/10"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Great view, good service . I booked for my anniversary"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Amazing!! I did surprise my wife with a romantic dinner in Mars Venus. Services were super nice
❤️"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,Fantastic experience and great staff. Highly recommend if you're looking for a romantic spot in D7.
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Very slow service. Food was ok but portions were way too small. Me and my wife left hungry after spending over 1,000,000vnd.

Obviously will not be coming back."
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"The atmosphere is great, the service was awesome.  Would recommend. Would come again"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Delicious foods, good service. Romantic place for couple"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,Trung is an excellent staff. Food is cooked to awesomeness and the atmosphere is warm and great.
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Minh Khang speaks great English and he is very helpful. I highly recommend the restaurant especially if you are craving European food. It’s very classy, and prices are reasonable. The food was amazing❤️❤️❤️🙏"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,This is a perfect place for couples and family on special occasions. The food is good and the service is excellent.

ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Great service! Minh Khangs’s treatment was amazing. KOODOS to the chef, the food here is as scrumptious! I highly recommend this place for amazing food and great service🙂👌🏾"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Food was terrible, not worth the price. Soups and meats and everything else are served almost cold. Feel like they just reheat every dish and bring them to us. Service was poor. For everything, we had to wait. Taking a bill took a long long time as well. Location was bad. Decorations were too much. Won't come back."
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Very chill, cozy and romantic vibe. Nice view over the river. The service is the hook: nice, friendly and well trained staff. Definitely would want to come back."
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Waiters are super nice and friendly, excellent customer service. They even help to set up the table for pictures.
Food is good enough, reasonable prices."
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Had a birthday party here, excellent service, very helpful and friendly. Food is delicious but the wait time may vary. Restaurant is spacious and chill. But boat to get here isn’t what’s in mind"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Great space for dinner, parking at the white restaurant nearby, crossing the pier and going to the right. All the Staffs are very friendly."
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,Lovely place! Great food and service. Definitely will come back!
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Fantastic restaurant for a surprise dinner. The restaurant is on an island that is only accessible by a ferry boat (free) and seems to cater to the romantic birthday and anniversary crowd.

Fix priced menu sets are available, along with cocktails and wine. Although not quite michelin star dining, the food was well plated and tasted amazing. I do wish the birthday cake came last though, and not first.

Service and setup were top tier, having customized birthday decorations, complete with picture frames of you and your significant other, and candles to complement the string lighting around the restaurant.

Overall, would highly recommend for a romantic special occasion or just semi private dining with great ambiance."
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Had a birthday celebration here the food was exceptional with a focus on fusion with bold flavours, would recommend the soft shell crab with linguini. Highly recommended to pay a visit for that special evening."
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"The restaurant is good with the atmosphere, the food and especially with the attitude of the all staff.
The price is acceptable, i did have a good time in here."
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"This is probably one of the greatest experience I ever been with. Great dining, good service and great experience."
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,So beautiful. Nice food. Great restaurant !

ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Very nice, cool atmosphere.
Above all, all of the dishes were perfect!!"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"This restaurant has such a wonderfully romantic setting as to not need especially good food, but good food it has in abundance. Portion sizes were perfect for us, though some may feel them small. Prices were reasonable we thought. The soups we had, though not filling by themselves, were delicious and The presentation for all the courses was fantastic. The service is impeccable, whoever trained these servers deserves double whatever their salary currently is.
To get there, you must park (if going by motorbike) in the lot next to the river just past the park, and take their complementary boat to the restaurant. Go to the right when you get off the boat and you'll find yourself in another world."
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,Good place for private dinner/ couple dinner/ Birthday/ dating
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,Came here for my birthday dinner. The atmosphere was great and the service was excellent. We had a great time!

1st .We were told due to demand (there was approximately 6 people there) My gf decided to  order a main course and French fries.
2nd . She was informed you had to order 2 Main courses!!! I was wondering where the beer we ordered 10 minutes ago was
3rd : This is because it's  a WESTERN restaurant! But nobody could (allegedly speak English"
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,Good
ChIJPx65eqgvdTERsHIZN9cx7OY,"Food is surprisingly good, the setting is romantic, suitable for couples and private event. It’s just a bit hot though."

The food was delicious, the music and vibe were perfect, and the service was 10/10. A perfect spot for a date night or just to relax and enjoy a nice dinner."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"We came to this restaurant with my boyfriend and received a very warm welcome. The meal was delicious, the atmosphere was pleasant with a pianist playing live music (and it was even possible to request a song), and the restaurant itself is beautiful. We were served by Nguyet, who was exceptional from start to finish. She is very attentive, helpful, and kind. Thank you again for this experience and for the thoughtful touch (the dessert plate) for my birthday.
We truly recommend this place ! :)"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Me and my partner are always on the lookout for great dining experience and curated menus when we travel. It is very rare that we will find a restaurant that would have the food on point from start to finish. Normally we will find something that would be average for our tasts…but NOT CLOUD NINE SAIGON!!!

From the entree to the dessert and the mocktail shots - this restaurant delivered! The food is not the only thing to rave about. The ambience, lighting, and service were all 5-star!

Special thanks to Nguyen for attending to us, and we cannot praise the chef and their team in the kitchen for the outstanding dishes served to us!

Highly recommended and I would not be surprised if they end up in michelin guide in the future."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Beyond My Expectations
I’ve dined here quite a few times, and I loved it so much that I decided to share my experience at Cloud Nine Restaurant.
I recently celebrated my birthday here.
I booked a decoration package for 1,500,000 VND, along with 8 Star Set menus, each priced at 1,500,000 VND for a 5-course meal, including appetizer, soup, salad, main course, and dessert.
Starting with the welcome experience:
As soon as I arrived, the receptionist kindly guided me to the car parking area right across from the hotel, very convenient for those who drive.
Upon entering the lobby, I was greeted with warm smiles from the staff, very friendly and welcoming.
When the elevator doors opened on the 11th floor, to the left was a stunning poolside area, which is also available for dining, absolutely gorgeous.
My table was beautifully arranged right next to the window, offering a fantastic view of Saigon's iconic buildings like Bitexco Tower and Saigon Centre.
The dishes were skillfully prepared and artistically presented, every course was captivating. The chef even came to the table personally to serve.
I was especially impressed by Thành, the staff member who took care of our table from start to finish. He was quick, cheerful, charming, and of course, very professional. I’m sure anyone who dines here will be charmed by him!
The restaurant space is stunning, with private rooms available. I also loved the wine cabinet and the stylish glassware, very classy.
As it was my birthday, the team surprised me with a cake and sang a birthday song. They even had a custom LED sign with my name on it!
To end the evening, Thành created a magical cocktail called “Gracias”, it was so impressive that everyone applauded.
Oh, what an enchanting night!
I’ll be proud to bring my friends here for future celebrations.
Thank you to the amazing Cloud Nine Restaurant team.
I’ll definitely celebrate my birthday here every year!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Honestly one of the best spots we’ve ever been to. The vibe is fun and chill, the staff are super friendly, funny, and easy to talk to. We felt welcome right away.

The show they put on is wild—in the best way. Cocktails on fire, meat literally getting torched at the table, and the whole thing looked amazing.

They even customized the menu to our crew’s favorite picks, and every single thing tasted great. You can really tell they care about the experience.

Highly recommend if you're looking for good food, good people, and a good time."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,My wife organised to celebrate my 30th birthday during our trip to Vietnam and I am so happy she did. One of the best atmospheres and service I have experienced. The food was also very high quality and plated very nice. I will definitely be back for any future celebrations when I come back to Vietnam. Highly recommend Cloud Nine!
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"An Unforgettable Dining Experience at Cloud Nine Saigon!

From the moment we walked in, Cloud Nine Restaurant delivered an exceptional experience — and it was all elevated by our amazing waitress, Nhung. Her attention to detail, warmth, and professionalism made our evening truly unforgettable.

We ordered the grilled salmon with passion fruit sauce, lamb chops with red wine sauce, and an avocado salad with prawn and caviar — each dish was absolutely mind-blowing. The ingredients were incredibly fresh, and everything was cooked perfectly to our liking. Nhung took our order flawlessly, described each dish with care, and ensured everything arrived just as we requested.

To top it off, we were surprised with complimentary starters and drinks after our meal, which was such a thoughtful gesture. And the dessert? Spectacular — the perfect finish to a phenomenal evening.

This is officially my favorite restaurant in Saigon, and Nhung is hands-down one of the best waitresses I've encountered in all my years in hospitality. We will absolutely be returning. Highly recommended!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"I had the pleasure of celebrating my friend’s birthday at Cloud Nine Restaurant, and it was hands down the best lunch I’ve had in a long time. From the moment we arrived, the vibe was warm and inviting — the perfect setting for a special celebration.

Our waitress, Phung Huynh, was absolutely fantastic. She was attentive, friendly, and made sure our meal went smoothly without ever being intrusive. Her recommendations were spot on and really elevated the experience.

As for the food, every dish was a flavor-packed delight. The freshness and presentation showed real care and skill in the kitchen. The [signature dish or your favorite meal] was a true standout — perfectly cooked and full of delicious seasoning. Paired with [a drink or side], it turned our lunch into something truly memorable.

All in all, Cloud Nine, combined with Phung’s excellent service and great company, made this birthday lunch unforgettable. I can’t recommend it enough and will definitely be back!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Instagram friendly…

The vibe brilliant, a truly great atmosphere with staff who couldn’t do enough for you.

That said all the food was bland and tasteless, no more so than the Korean noodles,

soo much was for show and it felt silly, such as the giant pepper grinder, or using a blow torch and setting fire to a steak at the tables that was cooked in a kitchen just so you can record them doing it.

Honestly we were simply not the demographic for this in anyway, and as such I can’t help but feel sad that we spent more money here than we did in the last week on food combined to feel like we were still hungry at the end of it."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Wow what a place! Beautiful interior, great atmosphere and absolutely delicious food. A great place to bring someone for a special occasion or if you are wanting a romantic/fancy dinner. Shout out to Phung for her exceptional service."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,In every way it’s one of the most romantic dining experiences we’ve had anywhere in the world. The view is incredible of course. The staff was attentive to every detail from adding a cute sequined table cloth to delivering a surprise desert delivered with a flaming reveal of a little love note on the plate that I’d asked them to prepare. The food was amazing especially the Sea Bass with lime leaves and the Waygu Beef Salad. It’s soo hard to explain how much they went above and beyond in every way. If you have a special occasion or just want to experience old school fine dining this is the spot in Saigon.
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"We had a team dinner for 25+ pax and everything was perfect! Jayden helped arrange tailored meal sets and even added guest names to the tables. Food was all nice, especially Bak Kut Teh is the must tryyyy for me. Staff were super attentive and sweet, and the live cooking was a great touch. The highlight was the Jazzer with his “old and gold” voice and melody, his surprised Vietnamese song made our night unforgettable. Highly recommendedddd"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Firstly, I would like to shout out to Ngan and the team for such an excellent service. The food is amazing and overall experience is wonderful. Unforgettable experience! Definitely will come back again. The best restaurant ever!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,Great atmosphere. Wonderful and very accommodating staff. We picked it for our anniversary dinner and had so much laughs and good memories. The staff assist you through the whole dining experience. We would come back if we ever travel back to Ho chi minh!
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"From the very beginning, Mr. Jayden has been nothing short of amazing. Planning a proposal is something you only do once, and I wanted it to be meaningful, smooth, and unforgettable and thanks to him and his incredible team, it truly was!

Jayden went above and beyond. He didn’t just follow instructions; he took the time to understand what I had in mind, and then added his own thoughtful suggestions to elevate everything. From choosing the perfect songs to planning the sequence of events down to the smallest detail, he made sure every moment flowed beautifully. His experience, creativity, and calm presence gave me so much confidence leading up to the big day.

On the actual night, everything was beyond what I imagined. The performance was heartfelt, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere of the restaurant felt so intimate and special, like it was made just for us. There was a quiet magic in the air. My partner and I felt completely immersed in the moment, and looking back, I wouldn’t change a single thing.

This wasn’t just a dinner or a proposal, it was an experience. One that we’ll remember for the rest of our lives!

I want to give my deepest thanks to the entire Cloud Nine Saigon team. Their warmth, attention to detail, and genuine care made us feel like we were the only two people in the world that night. We were truly on cloud nine.

To anyone who’s thinking of planning a surprise proposal, a celebration, or even just a romantic evening, please don’t hesitate to visit them. You’ll be in the best hands. This team doesn’t just create events; they create memories.

Thank you again, Mr. Jayden and team, for making one of the most important nights of our lives so perfect!! We’ll always be grateful!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"My colleagues and I spent the week in south Vietnam and decided to have a nice farewell dinner. We chose Cloud Nine and were so glad we did. The food was amazing, some of the best I have ever had. The presentation was equally as wonderful. The service of the staff was an A+ and the view of the city was great. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting HCMC.  Bravo!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"It was our first time celebrating our wedding anniversary, and I had requested a special table decoration to mark the occasion. The team went above and beyond, paying close attention to every detail to ensure our evening was both joyful and memorable. The food was delicious, the ambiance was lovely, and the service was simply outstanding.

A heartfelt thank you to Nhung, whose kindness and attentiveness made our celebration even more special. Her thoughtful gestures and warm hospitality truly elevated the experience. We’re deeply grateful to her and the entire team for creating such a beautiful memory for us. Highly recommended!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,Absolutely stunning food and atmosphere! Incredible service from the staff who were attentive and helpful. Exactly what we were looking for for a date night. They even had live piano!
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"It is one of the best dining experiences! I reserved a very nice table with a nice view.  The food was delicious.  Anhle was my server, and he was very attentive and pleasant.  He loves his job, and it shows. The food presentation is exceptional.  I loved everything from the pepper grinder presentation to the baked Alaska dessert. I would visit again.

The only thing I didn't like was the music selection.  It was too dramatic and opera style. Not appropriatefor the setting. I want to relax and not be rushed,  not hear this bellowing music.  I did mention it because it was too much.  I think they either turned off a speaker or turned it down.  Later, the music selection changed.

Overall,  it was a great experience and delicious."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"It is indeed our best decision to book this Cloud Nine Restaurant and dine there. Actually, we are staying at le siesta boutique hotel and we found out there was a fine dining restaurant with exceptionally high rating in reviews.

We were welcomed and served by two very friendly, passonate and knowledgeable servers named Ngan and Sommelier Thanh, we were impressed by the scrumptious food and their authentic presentations, highlighting a burning of rosemary infused aroma to the Aussie tenderloin, the red wine which Thanh recommended best compliment with our food; we also loved the ambience with our favourite romantic songs accompanying the nights nightscape of HCM city. I think the restaurant has done a good recruiting and training of staff. Happy staff brings happy guests. I believed every guest of the night could have the same joyful feeling as me. All in all, we had a memorable dinner tonight.

Cám ơn Ngan & Thanh !"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"We were so happy with this wonderful little restaurant- service & food were exceptional. We celebrated my husbands 70th birthday here ( tourists from Australia) The staff were so happy to be involved & helped make our evening really special . Our food was yummy , served with theatrical presentation & delicious . It’s was a very special evening & we were so happy we chose Cloud Nine - the staff made us all feel special ,especially my husband . A great night we have wonderful memories. Highly recommend this restaurant!!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"About dinner time, made a previous reservation on the 11th floor for my birthday eve. Service there were so lovely and waitress Nhung did a fantastic service tonight. The meals and desserts were all so good, highly recommend. So happy to have this perfect night here in the Cloud Nine."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Great place to go if you are looking for a fine dining experience in Saigon. The staff were incredible and attentive, and the ambience was so refined. Food was incredible, and it felt like an experience."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"We had a great time at Cloud Nine for our anniversary dinner. My partner booked it and told them that we would have an anniversary dinner. They gave us a surprise complimentary chocolate mousse as in picture. At the end of our time there, they surprised us again with a free mocktail made on our table.

Ngan Ngo and Tran always wanted to ensure that we had the best possible food and experience there.

The ambience was nice and romantic. The service was great. The price is reasonable for the quality of food and services offered there.

We definitely recommend this restaurant!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,Excellent experience. Amazing flavours and very well presented food. View was amazing. Staff were very attentive and friendly. Piano player was an excellent touch.  Got complementary cocktail.  Would highly recommend
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Went there for a friend’s birthday. We had a booking for 15 people but when we arrived it looked that they were not aware and that was the beginning to a very long evening. They had to set up the tables for us. They were very long to serve the food, we spent 3.5h in the restaurant for a starter and a main each.
When my burata (starter) was served it was still frozen inside, there was plastic on top. My neighbor got his Australian Tenderloin cooked way more than his request. The scallop was a bit fishy and the panned foie gras was served cold.
On a more positive note when a non frozen salad burata arrived it was actually very good and the correctly cooked Tenderloin was good, especially the sauce.
The waiters were very nice and apologized a lot for all the inconveniences."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"We had a wonderful experience at Cloud Nine Restaurant Saigon. The staff were warm, attentive, and made us feel very welcome. The food was beautifully presented and full of flavor — every dish was thoughtfully prepared. The atmosphere was calm and elegant, perfect for a relaxed evening. We’d definitely come back the next time we’re in Saigon."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Nguyet was an absolute delight, a wonderful host and amazing energy that made our last evening in Vietnam extra special ..thank you to the chef and bartender for the amazing food and drinks and the divine attention to detail! The whole staff of La Seista hotel are a gem and I recommend anyone visiting Ho Chi Minh to stay here"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,We were visiting HCMC on my wife's birthday with another couple and Cloud Nine was excellent in terms of service and cuisine.  We had to change our reservation due to a later flight departure from Da Nang but they accommodated  us with no issue.  Our food was excellent in terms of taste and quality and the  presentation is impressive.  To top it off the staff sang Happy Birthday and provided a yummy birthday dessert! I highly recommend giving them a try!
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,The best duck breast we’ve ever had! The service was even better — Nguyet gave us the best service we’ve ever experienced. We’ll definitely visit again! ✨👍
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Cloud Nine Restaurant was an absolutely amazing experience! The ambiance was elegant and artistic, with wonderful views of Saigon’s skyline that set the perfect mood. The food was exquisite—each dish was beautifully presented and packed with incredible flavours. The dessert was particularly exquisite. The staff were incredible! Fun, attentive, and ensured all of our needs were met during our dinner. It was truly a fantastic experience from start to finish. Highly recommend for anyone looking to elevate their dining experience in Saigon!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Absolutely outstanding.  This experience along with the food was made special by the incredible staff.

As a foodie, I’m impressed.
After visiting over 60 countries and hundreds if cities, I can tell you this is a great place to enjoy a dinner.

Thank you for making this all that it was."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Please, improve quality, again....
This time the pre-arranged 4 course menus for 1.5m VND each, were rather disappointing.
The show for 3 of the courses was nice, as always. Service rather good.
However, dining show and service should not be most important but quality of dishes, instead.
None of the courses in both different menus (one more meat, the other more fish) met expectations nor offered the known quality.
After honest and respectful feedback one menu didn't need to be paid, which was fair.
But to leave unsatisfied and hungry is not in expectations...."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Quite a wonderful experience. We had a lovely dinner with many pleasant memories to share. 10/10!
The server, Ms. Phung Huynh was attentive and very lovely."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"We had an absolutely delightful dining experience at Cloud Nine Restaurant! We opted for the set menu, and each dish was a true delight. The highlight of our evening was the exceptional service from our waitress, Nhung, who was incredibly attentive and made sure we felt well taken care of throughout the meal. The ambiance, combined with the panoramic city views, made for a perfect evening. We rate Cloud Nine a well-deserved 5 out of 5 and highly recommend it!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Amazing food, service is absolutely the best - Nhung and all the staff are very attentive - will definitely come back!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Truly exceptional. Cloud Nine is one of the best restaurants I’ve ever been to! Great good, great drinks, and top notch service. Anh Le was the best server— very friendly and accommodating. Had one of the best dinners here and I’ll definitely dine here again when I’m back in HCM. Thank you! 😊"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Went to try out cloud nine after reading raving reviews.  After stepping out of the elevator, I knew it will be a disappointment.   Restaurant is edged next to a swimming pool.  Musty air with swimmers splashing next to you makes not an elegant atmosphere for a fine dining.  Dining presentation were OK though overly eager to please were obvious.   Most importantly food were bland and lacking basics like dry tenderloin that were supposedly cooked medium rare.   Deserts were plain tasting while pleasing to eyes.
Overall, a big disappointment and added to my regret for wasting a night of dining when we could have sampled fine local dining scene. We will spend next two nights we have on this trip at a fine Vietnamese establishments instead of..."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Wow what a fabulous surprise to find a restaurant of this quality equal to any in London Melbourne or Sydney. The service was first class and personal. Anh Le was engaging helpful but not intrusive.
The food was superb."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Had dinner with a group of friends. Left a little disappointed. Service was great as was the atmosphere but the food was passable at best. Had the smoked salmon to start, a Caesar salad, the grilled salmon and the Baked Alaska. The grilled salmon was unfortunately quite dry and not particularly tasty. The rest of the dishes were ok."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"We went here for my anniversary meal last week. The food was good for its value. Anh Le was our server for the night and his service was impecable. We also had a 10% discount voucher for the bar above, which had an amazing view. Would definitely come back again next time we visit Sai Gon."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Our group of 50 recently had the privilege of hosting a high-stakes business dinner at Cloud Nine Saigon, and the experience surpassed every possible expectation. From the moment we arrived, the team delivered service of the highest imaginable standard — seamlessly blending attentiveness, professionalism, and warmth to create an atmosphere perfectly suited for an important corporate occasion.

The staff handled the size and significance of our event with absolute precision. Every detail — from the elegant table settings and flawless coordination to the attentive pacing of courses — was executed with effortless grace. No request was too small, and no element was overlooked. The service team anticipated our needs before we even expressed them, ensuring that each guest felt personally cared for despite the scale of the gathering.

The culinary experience was equally exceptional. Each dish was crafted with exquisite attention to both presentation and flavor, leaving a lasting impression on our international guests. The menu struck the perfect balance between local sophistication and global appeal, contributing to an atmosphere of understated luxury that reflected exceptionally well on our organization.

Cloud Nine Saigon did not merely provide a venue — they orchestrated an evening that elevated our event into a truly memorable occasion. For anyone seeking to host an important business dinner where impeccable service, refined cuisine, and a flawless setting are non-negotiable, Cloud Nine Saigon stands in a league entirely of its own."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Dining at Cloud 9 was truly a highlight of our trip through Vietnam. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, making it a wonderful place to unwind. Our waitress, Moon, was exceptionally friendly and attentive, ensuring we felt valued and taken care of throughout our meal. We genuinely appreciated her kindness and the amazing service she provided. Thank you for creating such a memorable evening for us; it was a perfect way to cap off our journey."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"We had a fantastic dinner at Nine Cloud Saigon Restaurant to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. The food was delicious, and the atmosphere was amazing. The restaurant wasn't crowded, likely because we visited on a weekday. The ambiance is romantic and luxurious, making it an ideal spot for a couple's fine dining experience.

Max Vu, the manager, was incredibly helpful. He received the flowers I had delivered earlier in the day and ensured everything went smoothly. He even texted me to ask for my girlfriend's name so they could prepare a personalized banner and put her name on the complimentary cake. He was friendly and provided excellent customer service.

Our server, Ann Tran, was very polite and attentive. She made sure we enjoyed our meal and checked in on us regularly. Ann Tran and Max, along with the rest of the staff, surprised us with a birthday song, a banner, and a chocolate mousse cake, which we greatly appreciated.

This place is truly wonderful, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a memorable dining experience. If you are looking for great service, this is the place to go."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Great food, fairly cheap relative to Australian prices. Service was great and the staff were lovely."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Expensive for a reason. Food is great, staff is extremely hospitable and attentive, and it's on the top floor of the hotel La Siesta. A wholesome experience for a special occasion."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Phung Huynh was our waitress and we appreciate her service, she was very helpful and attend to us with a smile. There are so much varieties of food, option from pho to all style of eggs, all the exotic fruits you could ask for when in vietnam. Will definitely come again."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"We visited this restaurant on our first night in the city, and we were immediately impressed by the warm and welcoming atmosphere, as well as the friendly and attentive staff. While the food is good, I found the prices to be a bit steep, especially considering that they’re comparable to or even higher than what you'd pay in Europe or Australia. Although the menu offers some solid dishes, it lacks a wide variety of authentic Vietnamese options, with most choices leaning more towards Western-style food. Overall, it’s a nice spot, but it may not offer the best value for those looking for an authentic local experience."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Good stuff, nice environment. Nice playlist and romantic scene, the lights are on point, aesthetically presented food and a bonus Mocktail"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,Had our 3rd anniversary here. I told them and they organised flowers that I asked. What a great restaurant. Food was fantastic and service was great. Great experience especially for special occasions. Well Done guys.
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"I recently dined at Cloud Nine Restaurant and was truly impressed. The service was professional and attentive, especially Tuan Anh, who was knowledgeable and welcoming. His recommendations were spot-on, adding a personal touch to the experience.
The ambiance is stunning, with panoramic views of Saigon and elegant décor that creates a perfect setting. Each dish was beautifully presented and full of flavor—a true culinary delight.
For a memorable dining experience with top-notch service, Cloud Nine is highly recommended!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Amazing food and really nice atmosphere with good view. Had the 5 course meal with steak that came with some great presentation. The service was amazing, shoutout to Anh Le for taking good care of me and being so attentive. If you’re looking for some good steak I would definitely recommend."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"This restaurant is incredible. The staff were so attentive the whole night and made sure we were happy. I had the best steak ever here at cloud nine (you get a nice show as well and it gets cooked in front of you)!!! The atmosphere was romantic which was a bonus as we celebrated our anniversary here! Anh le was an incredible host and waiter all night. He was funny, polite and friendly! He asked if we would like any pepper and brought out a massive pepper grinder haha! To anyone who has him as a waiter is lucky! He made sure our anniversary was perfect and it was! The whole experience and food was a 10/10. My partner and I loved this place so much we will be back!!! Please come here for the amazing food, ambiance and staff. You won’t be disappointed! Also, they have good vegetarian options!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Wonderful restaurant!
Thanks for all they did to the birthdaystar.
Nice food and wine, especially the sense of ceremony."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"My partner and I had the pleasure of dining at Cloud Nine Restaurant, and it was an unforgettable experience. From the moment we walked in, the high-end atmosphere and soothing classical music set the perfect tone for the evening.

We started with the spring rolls, which were fresh and came with two delightful dipping sauces: fish sauce and peanut. For our main courses, we had the chicken roulade and pork short ribs, both of which were cooked to perfection and bursting with rich, savory flavors. The meal was perfectly capped off with the bombe Alaska, a dessert that was as beautiful as it was delicious.

Our evening was made even more special by our server, Tran Pham, who was incredibly attentive and helpful throughout our meal. Her service was nothing short of exceptional, deserving a perfect 10 out of 10.

While you can expect to pay for the premium service and atmosphere, it is worth every penny. The food was divine, the service impeccable, and the overall experience was top-notch. We will definitely be coming back to Cloud Nine Restaurant."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,If you are in Ho Chi Mi City you MUST dine here!  Stumbled across this place on our last night in town and I have to say what a way to say goodbye to Vietnam.  This is any foodies dining heaven!!! To top it off the service staff were next level amazing!!! The views were perfect - the whole experience is a 10/10.  This experience is definitely a highlight - put it on your dining experience bucket list!
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Cloud Nine offers exceptional food, warm ambiance, and attentive service, making it a must-visit for anyone seeking a delightful dining experience. The staff were incredibly friendly. Thank you, Anh Tran, for your excellent service and making my special day so memorable 🙂

ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,The food is good the ambiance is fantastic.Phung is verry accommodating. its a 10/10.
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Had a magical night here at Cloud Nine. The food was splendid. The ambiance was luxurious and relaxing. The service was top-notch.

I had both the special menu’s 5 course meal. Each and every course was such a delight.

Anh Tran was very nice and accommodating. She would regularly check up on us to ensure everything was going well.

Overall, I would come back again when I am in town. This experience is truly amazing and is a highlight of my trip to HCMC."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Cloud Nine Saigon is a place I’ve had the pleasure of visiting twice now, and it’s clear that the improvements to their menu have made a significant impact. The dishes are not only delicious but also thoughtfully curated, showcasing a refined selection. The staff is attentive, professional, and truly goes above and beyond to ensure a seamless dining experience. The ambiance is warm, romantic, and inviting—perfect for couples looking for a special night out. It’s truly an ideal spot for those seeking an unforgettable evening in the heart of Saigon."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"We were expecting a lot from this restaurant, given the 5/5 rating on Google Maps, which we did not find warranted at all. There certainly were a few amusing ""show"" elements, with a blow torch here and dry ice there, but the substance--that is, the actual quality of the food and service expertise--was severely lacking. In my 5-course tasting menu, the appetizers were tiny, the salad thereafter ok but not splendid, and the main course average at best. The vegetarian main course was below par (a portion of dry rice, topped with cheese, with a tiny bit of veggies added), barely edible. The price was very high by Saigon standards, especially for what ended up on the plate. To top it all off, the restaurant did not accept USD (unlike pretty much anywhere else in the city), and an extra charge was added to pay by card. There is just no way this place deserves a score that high, and one can only wonder how this is possible."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,I'm happy to have an unforgettable birthday. I enjoyed the tasty food and the performance show. I'm very grateful for the wonderful hospitality.Thank you so much.I appreciate it.
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,What a lovely and elegant place in the middle of Saigon! Food was excellent and service great. We were looked after by Anh Le who ensured our glasses were full and e explained the food ingredients very well! Quiet and relax place to be enjoying great food!
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"What a wonderful restaurant! At every turn there was a new surprise! The view is on a high floor overlooking the city,  the service is perfect and the food is just spectacular! Vu Le was so helpful and professional as was the woman who first waited on us. A really marvelous restaurant."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,Such an amazing restaurant and our waitress Nhung was so lovely
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Excellent food and service. Very nice, quiet atmosphere. Expect to pay more, but it's well worth it. A great place to celebrate any occasion with fine dining. Highly recommend."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"We had the most amazing experience at Cloud Nine Restaurant ! Everything from start to finish was amazing . Our server Ngan Ngo was so lovely and very attentive .Ngan had a really lovely manner and nothing  was too much trouble . We would definitely recommend this restaurant , 11 out of 10 for sure ! Thank you so much ! X"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"I had a wonderful experience at Cloud Nine Saigon, and I was especially impressed by the professionalism and friendliness of Tong, the bartender.

From the moment I arrived, Tong made me feel welcomed with his warm and attentive service. Not only were his drinks delicious and beautifully presented, but his deep knowledge of cocktails and his thoughtful recommendations truly enhanced my experience. He communicated with such politeness and always wore a genuine smile, creating a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere throughout the evening.

Each drink he crafted had a perfect balance of flavor and aesthetics, clearly showing his passion for mixology. What stood out even more was his attention to detail, ensuring every guest felt satisfied and well taken care of.

Cloud Nine is already known for its elegant setting and refined cuisine, but it’s the dedication of staff like Tong that truly makes it a memorable destination. I will definitely return and highly recommend it to friends."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Delicious Happy Birthday Surprise. I ordered the Australian Tenderloin, cooked Medium it was not overcooked and was perfect. Everything was delicious, Spicy fried noodles no meat, Pho, Spaghetti Bolognese, spring shrimp rolls, Chicken roulade, Chief salad, Vietnamese coffee and crème brûlée ."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"I recently had the pleasure of visiting Cloud 9 and was truly impressed by its elegant atmosphere, breathtaking view, and outstanding service. It’s the perfect spot to unwind after a long day or enjoy a stylish night out with friends or loved ones.

One of the highlights of my visit was the bar, which not only offered creative and well-balanced cocktails but was also staffed by an excellent bartender named Tong. He was not only skilled in mixology but also incredibly friendly and attentive. Tong took the time to recommend drinks based on my preferences, and thanks to his finesse, I ended up enjoying one of the best cocktails I’ve had in a long time—unique, smooth, and perfectly crafted.

Overall, Cloud 9 exceeded my expectations in every way. From the ambiance and food quality to the drinks and top-notch service, everything was five-star. A special thank you to bartender Tong for making the night extra memorable."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"This restaurant was luxurious and made me feel fancy. The food was impeccably good and made my stomach very happy. The workers are extremely welcoming and helpful. Although the portions are small, the food is the best I’ve tasted in my entire life — and I’ve eaten a lot of food. This was the best restaurant I’ve ever visited in my entire life, and I definitely recommend it."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Interesting place. The atmosphere was great, it's a beautiful location with great views, and a great decor.

Service was friendly and attentive.

Presentation on food was great, cocktails were great.

Why 4*? The food was just average. We both had different tasting menus, so tried a total of 10 dishes. Everything was ok. The presentation on a few were amazing, but the actual taste was pretty meh."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Our family absolutely loved our experience at your restaurant! Your service was outstanding, and every staff from the bar to the kitchen, all the food servers and receptionists made us feel so welcome. Tje food was delicious - the definitely worth returning. One of the best meals and the best place we have had in a while. Thank you so much for such a wonderful service. We can't wait to come back! Anh Le and others are so great!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Cloud Nine Restaurant was such a nice surprise – great vibes and a cool view.
The food was super tasty, especially Seafood Consommé and Truffle Spaghetti.
Staff were really friendly and made us feel welcome.
Prices were fair for what you get.
Definitely a spot I’d go back to with friends!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"I had a delicious breakfast at cloud nine restaurant this morning.  The inviting soft music and beautiful tables chairs and sofas were backdrop for delicious sausages, congee, eggs, and noodles. The server, a polite and engaging young man, named Anh on his name tag, even explained the street layout and suggested several sites for my walking adventures in ho chi m8nh, as he served hot coffee with condensed milk.  A great way to start my sight seeing tour of this interesting city today! Delicious!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"A truly elevated dining experience.

We enjoyed an exquisite pescatarian meal that delighted the palate. The flavors were refined, beautifully balanced, and left us genuinely impressed. The staff were warm, attentive, and professional, striking the perfect balance between hospitality and discretion. The ambience was serene and thoughtfully curated, with décor that complemented the experience perfectly."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Absolutely amazing experience. We had Phung as our server tonight. I organised a special night for my girlfriend and was not disappointed. I had the restaurant contact me in advance for offering a birthday package. It was well worth it. A bouquet of flowers always makes women happy.

Can't recommend cloud nine enough. The tenderloin is amazing and my partner had braised sea bass with steamed rice. Both were absolutely amazing. My partner loved the baileys espresso martini! They even played a happy birthday song over the speakers whilst they brought out a cake for her birthday.

Next time I'm in Saigon I will be back!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Exceptional dining experience, one of the best we’ve had - food, service and atmosphere top notch.

ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"This restaurant is a true gem in Saigon. The food is absolutely delicious, music supports an elevated dinner atmosphere and the drinks are to the point. Jayden and his team are super friendly and attentive. Any time we celebrate an occasion we come here."

ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,We had wonderful (and fancy!) dinner at Cloud Nine.  Everything was artfully presented and the waiter and his team were fantastic.  They gave beautiful views of HCMC!
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"OMG, save up and go, this is an absolutely awesome experience. My wife and I went on our last dinner before leaving Vietnam, our only regret we couldn’t go back. Wine list was great for the region, service and attentive staff impeccable. After dinner make sure you go upstairs to the sky bar to take in the awesome views (restaurant will also give you a voucher after dining). Can’t say enough!!!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,Great spot for some modern Vietnamese / western food. Definitely get the scallops with foie gras. The bak kut teh is a little salty though...
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,This was one of the best dinners I’ve ever had for under $50. The food was just out of this world and the overall ambiance was great. Definitely a 5 star restaurant. Nhung was incredible! Ask for her as your server!
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Simply delightful, from cocktails to main course and dessert. Highly recommended. Short ribs were amazing. And that corn crème brûlée, oh my!!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,Great last night in. Saigon! The food and atmosphere was first class and the service was OUTSTANDING. Special shout out to Nhung who made the whole night extra special for us. Highly recommend.
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,We hand a wonderful dinner tonight with Nhung helping us throughout the night. My husband and I both had sea bass - one braised and one grilled. They were both delicious!

ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Lovely food and personal service - thank you Nhung
Great after dinner drink - thank you Truong
Nice music - couldn’t fault anything"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"My partner and I recently had the pleasure of dining at Cloud Nine Saigon, and it was truly an unforgettable experience.
As soon as we entered, we were captivated by the sophisticated Indochina-inspired design. The soft lighting, plush seating, and panoramic views of the city skyline created an atmosphere of warmth and intimacy. The gentle background music added to the romantic ambiance, making it feel like we were in our own private world .
The staff at Cloud Nine went above and beyond to make our evening special. Particularly memorable were Quoc do, Hien do, Thanh le whose genuine smiles and attentive service made us feel like honored guests. Their thoughtful gestures, such as personalized recommendations and ensuring our comfort throughout the evening, added a personal touch that enhanced our dining experience.
The menu at Cloud Nine offers a delightful fusion of Vietnamese and international flavors. We started with the lobster bisque, which was rich and flavorful. For the main course, I opted for the Australian tenderloin, while my partner chose the lamb chops—both were cooked to perfection, tender, and juicy. To finish, we indulged in the crème brûlée and chocolate mousse, both of which were decadent and satisfying .
Cloud Nine Saigon isn't just a restaurant; it's a destination for romance. The combination of exquisite cuisine, impeccable service, and a breathtaking setting makes it the perfect place to celebrate love and create lasting memories. Whether it's an anniversary, a special date night, or simply a desire to indulge in luxury, Cloud Nine Saigon is a must-visit."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,Had tuan anh as my waiter and was excellent from start to finish. Definately recommend the set menu as it had many of flavors. Will definately come back again 10/10.
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Everything was absolutely perfect. Than, our waiter was outstanding. We enjoyed a lot"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"I had a great experience last night at your restaurant and I want to mention the waitress named Nhung, she so friendly and attentive. Beautiful place and great staff!!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"I figured I should say something after my third time at this wonderful restaurant! The WOW factor is everywhere from the moment you walk in. Service is fantastic, and I’m happy to mention the lovely Ms Nhung, who is just a joy to engage with and so very helpful. Wow for the food! Presentation is amazing, and everything is crazy delicious. Ambiance is a Wow as well. Can’t recommend this place more highly. Enjoy a spectacular dinner, then head up to the equally amazing sky bar."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Came with my partner for anniversary, really good atmosphere for couple. Wonderful service and location. Recommended!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,The whole staff were very great! It made our special day more special. Thank you so much! Will definitely come back here.
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"amazing food. amazing atmosphere. and even better staff. if you don’t come here you’re missing out. would come back again no problem

shout out to Nhung Do!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Wonderful atmosphere, delicious food and great service! I highly recommend for fine dining in Saigon. Our waitress was Nhung and she did amazing work giving recommendations and making dining experience pleasant. I hope we can return."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"We were staying at the sister hotel. Disappointed there is no loyalty programme or discount for guests. Cocktails better in sister hotel. Food fine but not amazing for the cost. Wine selection was well chilled. Water pricey. Poor dessert selection so didn’t bother.
It was convenient for us to visit but not sure the whole experience was worth 4.5m vnd for one course & a bottle of wine for two people.
They insisted our cocktails were paid for before the meal!"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,Bad service. As soon as I walked in I told staffs at lobby I was going to the restaurant. Hang out in the lobby for 1 hour and finally went to the elevator to be told by a different staff that the restaurants were closed for an event. Why not telling me that when I first came in the lobby or while I was sitting in the lobby?!
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"We just walked by and found this beautiful restaurant on 11st floor. Outside, Inside make your choice."
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,"Planned this a nice dinner celebration with my mom and disappointing experience. Food is OK but it looks they have more fun on showing off firing/flaming stuff to customers tables than focusing on the food. I was dining on the mezzanine, under staffed. I had to poor my wine bottle by myself coz nobody there. Entrée took like 30 mins to come in when restaurant was 50% empty. I add to order bread... I am expat, sorry, but the English waitress was more tham average (but she was polite and smiley). Finally a whole family was having dining and one of the kids was playing with his loud toy (I have 2 little ones but I teach them to behave at fine dining or I don't go if they look too distracted) - cannot blame the restaurant for this one thou. One side note: thanks to Anh Le for his ""gracias"" drink"
ChIJzZmzw0gvdTERMd1Mj0vWl6g,One of the nicest meals I have had in a long time.  The staff were friendly with a sense of fun and patient while we made our choices from the menu.  The food was delicious with a wide choice to suit all palates as is the wine list. The restaurant is lovely in itself with beautiful decor.  All these things come together to make a real dining experience.
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Too many good vibes I don’t even know where to start
Talking about the food everything was just perfect. Everyone must try the pizza, smoked pork, and chicken wings, because the flavors are truly special not generic

As for the atmosphere, it was amazing. I’ve been to Vũng Tàu quite a few times, but this was my first time visiting this restaurant and it made this trip the most wonderful Vũng Tàu trip we’ve ever had. The guests were cheerful, and the staff and mr.C's were so friendly and welcoming.

mr.C's, he was wonderful! Very kind, attentive, and took great care of every customer. Maybe because we were having such a great time that day, he gave us extra delicious food and a cute little gift to take home.

This is definitely a place worth experiencing!"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Mr. C Bar in Vung Tau is a fantastic spot for anyone looking to enjoy cold drinks while catching up on sports. The atmosphere is lively and welcoming, making it the perfect place to relax with friends or family.

What truly stands out is the food. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are all exceptional, but you absolutely must try the wood-oven pizza’s. They’re perfectly cooked, with a delicious crust and fresh toppings that make each bite a treat. The menu offers a variety of options, ensuring there’s something for everyone.

Overall, Mr. C Bar is a must-visit destination in Vung Tau, combining great drinks, a vibrant sports vibe, and outstanding food. Highly recommended!"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Mr. C's now offering a great breakfast option with daily specials. A good alternative with all bacon, ham and sausage smoked and made on site. Super friendly staff and owner! And always playing current North American Sports! Lets go Blue Jays! Lets go Oilefs!"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Cozy, rustic, and welcoming place with delicious food — especially the grilled dishes!
The owner is super friendly, even gave my wife a gift, and made we feel right at home.
We stayed 3 days and 2 nights and had dinner here both nights — you should definitely try it!"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Pizzas r so delicious. The owner is friendly. If u need a place to eat n chill or to share stories, u better to come here. It’s perfect"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"This pizza makes me want to go back to Vũng Tàu again just for it. It’s too vibrant to be called a traditional Italian taste, and too light and wholesome to be considered the heavy American style. With plenty of onions and bell peppers, it strangely reminds me of the comforting flavors of a Korean mother’s cooking. The crust, baked in a wood-fired oven, is wonderfully crispy, and with each bite the rich vegetable juices from the generous onions and peppers fill my mouth—it’s absolutely delicious. I’m already planning to go back with my colleagues to enjoy it again."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Nice chilled place to go, pizza is great, cold beer and good service.  I definitely recommend to try here."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,The pizza is delicious. The owner is professional. The restaurant is clean. I love it. I highly recommend it.
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Great place to come for ice cold beers and quality food and service... sports on TV and wood fire oven.. friendly locals too... I come back every time I am in vt.. thanks team 👌👏👍🍺🍕
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"What a great experience we had here. 2 years in a row, back to the same place, for drinks and a feed. Great atmosphere, great prices, even greater pizza!!! Thanks Randy and team for a wonderful few nights visiting Vung Tau, you made our stay so welcoming! Do not miss this place if you are in town!"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"What can I say. I've been coming to Vietnam for 15 years and lived here for 1 year in 2014. The Mr C Special Pizza 🍕 is the best I've had anywhere in VN and up there with pizzas back in Australia. Wood fired cooked just right. When I'm next in Vung Tau I will definitely come the Mr C's again. Oh yeah, cold beers 🍻 at a very reasonable price as well. Randy the owner and chef has done a great job with the bar..."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"We would take very serious the negative reviews, and in particular,  the responses from the owner, which we believe is everything that’s wrong.

The photo doesn’t lie... that pizza is blackened all around the edges. Not “charred” or “wood-fired rustic”, just burnt.

Burnt is burnt.

Go online and search for wood fired pizza from any reputable place in Vũng Tàu.

You’ll see blistered spots and a bit of darkening, not a crust that looks like charcoal. There’s a big difference between flavor from fire and flat out overcooking.

Even the other pizza pics from here look normal. Why so defensive?

That isn’t ""wood-fired flavor"", it’s a mistake that should have never left the kitchen.

Instead of apologizing and owning it, the owner blamed the customer.

They told them they should’ve asked questions before ordering, and that burnt is to be expected.

Crazy.

Then finishes with a patronizing “I hope my advice helps with your future dining experiences.”

That’s not accountability. That’s arrogance.

Geeze... Customers don’t need to interrogate a restaurant before placing an order. To look around and check the food.

They need a business that simply takes pride in its product.

Based on the owners' responses to negative reviews,  with that attitude, imagine what would have happened if the customers had said something when they were here.

Scary.

This is exactly why people speak up in reviews, because clearly, if they had spoken up in person, they’d have been dismissed just the same."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"AMAZING EXPERIENCE AND SERVICE
walked in met the staff then the patrons then the king of Vung Tau pizzas Mr C aka Randy I put high expectations out and he delivered"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"I didn’t except pizza so good in Vung Tau!
Randy has this friendly place with pizza oven where you feel like you are back home!
Pizza dough was spot on and homemade smoked meats were top tier!

7⭐️ out of 5!"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"I had a fantastic time! The pizza was delicious, and the beers were perfectly cold. The owner was really down-to-earth and great to chat with. Listening to the classic rock music was a joy; I could easily have stayed a couple more hours."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"I love pizza at this restaurant.
It’s tasty and the price is reasonable"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Terrific place to unwind and meet great friendly people. First class service with a frosty cold beer and am a Pizza cooked by the owner Randy. Best In town.
Very much worth a visit"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,We had the best time at Mr. C's! There are always a few people there to have a good chat with and the staff is super friendly. Our kid was entertained by the pool table and fish aquariums! This will be our first stop when we're coming back to Vung Tau next time.
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Open area bar/pub, relaxed atmosphere, pleasant & friendly service, limited food menu, but the pizzas from the wood-fired oven are probably the very best in Vung Tau!"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"My go-to place for pizza, speaking as someone who lives here; it's easily the tastiest on offer in Vung Tau. Service is excellent and staff are very friendly and welcoming. Good tunes, inexpensive beer and laid back vibe, ideal."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Group of 13 of us arrived unannounced on a Friday early evening. Quite a large food order and at least 10 other diners also ordering at similar times. Pizzas, Ribs, Wings etc. perfectly timed. We all ate and drank together. Absolutely delicious food. One of our favourite spots in Vung Tau. Cheers to Randy and your staff."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Awesome cozy restaurant and bar. The food is ridiculously good and all hand made in an authentic brick pizza oven. Prices are low considering what you get and the owners are amazing social people. Definitely worth checking it out for supper and drinks!
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Ordered an Italian but got a different pizza. Also said no onion. Came with onion. Delivery was late and the price was higher than the one posted online 4 months ago.
Owner rude. Please don't go here."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"The pizza portions are really big. Two people can easily share one pizza and feel full. Plus, they are absolutely delicious! They are baked in a specially made stone oven, which makes a big difference. You should definitely try this place—it’s amazing! The only downside is that it’s a bit expensive for Vietnam, but it’s totally worth the price."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Great little pub with a wide variety of patrons from all over the world who make you feel welcome. We had pizza and the amazing ribs and watched Australian rugby league and had a natter with the regulars
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Great bar with great food. Wonderful service and now with expanded menu. Pizzas the highlight!
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Great place to hang out. Food is banging. Huge portions. Drinks are decent and a pool table out the back. Will be there next time I'm in Vung Tau. Thanks Andy
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"What a absolutely  lovely  place ,to eat a fantastic  pizza  ,and to chat  with the  owner  and patrons,  thanks  so much  to you  all ,for  making  our  last  couple  of days  in Vung tau  memorable  ,cheers  xx Chris and  Donald  ,see you  next  time"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Pizza there is best in this city. Great guy. I send best regards 😊
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Two Canadians walk into a bar… and five hours later, they’re still there! That’s exactly what happened to us at this incredible spot. The people were so amazing—friendly, hilarious, and downright delightful—that we completely lost track of time just hanging out. It felt like we were at a backyard party with old friends!

Oh, and the food? Don’t even get me started. The Woodfire pizza was a masterpiece—the crust was *perfectly cooked*, with that ideal balance of crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, and the smoky flavor from the woodfire oven took it to another level. And the chicken wings? They were cooked *inside the woodfire oven* too, giving them this incredible smoky, crispy perfection that had us licking our fingers clean.

If you’re looking for great food, great vibes, and a place where time flies, this is it. Just don’t blame me if you end up staying for five hours too!"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Where do I start,, we arrived and didn't feel at all welcome, we ordered a pizza  and waited well over an hour for it to arrive. Pizza wasn't bad but was far from good. Base was far to thick and all the edges were burnt black but very expensive and when it came to paying, the final bill, it came to 335k with a drink,, paid the lady 435k so I'd get 100k back and she just said thank you and kept the change.
Would not recommend this place or the burnt food"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Best pizza in Vung Tau. Ice cold beers too. Great for watching NFL, NHL."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"This is a must visit pub. The food is incredible. The hospitality is the best in Vung Tau and they have North American Sports.
Have cheers with the regulars and have a great time.
Randy and Tam are great hosts."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Best pizza in Vung Tau and Randy is a great host.  Very kid friendly and good for families.
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"I was craving pizza yesterday, had read some glowing reviews about Mr. C’s pizza, thought to myself, this couldn’t be true so stopped in for some take away to see if the hype was for real. Randy and his lovely lady have a great vibe, the place is cozy, charming and inviting with a pool table in the back surrounded by tanks of colorful fish. Took the pizza home, the #3 ( most popular according to customers) and it was still piping hot as it had just come out of the wood-fire oven, took one bite and was utterly convinced, this is absolutely the best pizza in Vung Tau. I consider myself a pizza connoisseur, having had pizza all over the world, including Italy. Crust was perfectly crisp yet soft, toppings and sauce plentiful with complexity of fresh seasoned flavors with the perfect amount of melted cheese. I am converted. Mr, C’s wears the crown.
My family had already had dinner so I enjoyed the pizza myself, I couldn’t stop eating even though I was totally full and almost finished the whole pie.
Randy and staff, you have won over a new customer so you’ll have to get used to seeing our faces!
By the way. I’ve got 2 nice pieces of gnarly wood to add to your fish tanks I’ll bring by next time."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Great place for good pizzas 🍕 and chicken wings and other food. Also a great place for a beer and a chat...
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Pizza was a 10, fr. The lady running register was best bar staff ever, johnny on the spot type ish for food and drinks. Great atmosphere."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"recommended for dinner and a couple of drinks. the pizza is excellent, the staff are super nice, and the outdoor area is nice and open. there’s a decent pool table inside too. not sure i’d hang out here too often just for beers, as it felt kinda like a sports bar, with an older expat crowd and families, so maybe not the best choice if you’re younger and want to meet people. definitely worth checking out for the food and friendly service regardless."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Best bar in Vung Tau, with the best host. Great pizza, wings and ribs, and if you're stuck Randy (the host) will look after you. We arrived after breakfast had finished, but before dinner service, so he rustled up a great sandwich with his homemade bacon! Can't say enough good about the place or the owner!"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Awesome pizza and great people. Having tried numerous pizza in Vung Tau over the years, Randy has mastered it. Stone oven, very tasty toppings and the pizza was not soggy like so many others. Perfect. Had pizza #2.

Nice to meet you guys this evening!

Chris, another canuck!"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Casual bar with amazing wood-fired pizza, and great service. Only place you can get a really good Caesar as well."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Great pizzas from Randy and his wood fired oven. Always a pleasure in this friendly place. Never go to Vung Tau without a visit. Also good for Canadian sports :)
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Amazing!  Great pizza and atmosphere 🤩
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"I was a regular of Tommy's bar in its time.
We can't judge Mr C's by looking backwards.
Randy has done a brilliant job, reinventing and creating his own, iconic Vung tau landmark. Welcoming atmosphere,  FANTASTIC pizzas from proper oven... we also had Chicken Wings.
It was great to see 'regulars' taking residence.
The booming Karaoke from next door.... or perhaps cats were being strangled????? ..... didn't detract from this warm, friendly, superb venue and jolly decent host.
We'll be back."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,The only food I miss from home is pizza couple friends took me here the pizza here is one of the best I have ever had and I don't mean in Vietnam you gota try it most pizza here is Ketchup on toast. also ice cold beers and great staff
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Great Bar & lovely staff. Had a chicken baguette for lunch it was Banging 😋 Ended up pouring with rain so we left earlier than planned and the lovely staff arranged our taxi as grab cancelled on us. A great afternoon thankyou !! 🙏💙
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"After looking for good pizza in HCMC and Vung Tau Mr C's checks all the boxes. Wood fired, good crust and fresh ingredients. Delicious and healthy."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"It's such an awesome place. Appreciate you Randy, Tam, Bill,  & the rest of the crew for welcoming  me to Mr C's.  Whats not  to like about having cold beer, while eating delicious  food with cool folks from all around the World.  Mr C's rocks!!"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Best pub in the area! Great staff, super friendly, two tvs to watch sport and Awsum pizzas made by the owner. Highly recommend a visit"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Excellent service and very welcoming. Randy and Tam are fantastic hosts offering outstanding friendly service. The wood fired pizzas are the best you will find in vietnam.
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Nice ambiance. Good food. Wood fired pizza oven. Cold Huda beer. Reasonable price.
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,A great place to have a nice quiet chill and enjoy the cold beer 👌
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,When in Vung Tau and you want pizza this is the place cold beer and great atmosphere
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Great place for eats and drinks. Good company and atmosphere.
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Fantastic pizza from wood oven stove.
Causual friendly staff are welcoming."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Had a couple of pizzas last night with some beers, food was great, beers cold, nice and quiet place to just chill out and relax....Will be back..."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,I've been in Vietnam for 7 years. This has the best pizza I've ever had in the country.
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Chill pub and restaurant
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Enjoyed breakfast on the patio. Lucky the owner's dog was friendly.

ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Best bar and pizza in Vung Tau
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Has changed from one original large pub to three smaller places

My favorite dish is: mashed potatoes baked with cheese and bacon inside. 10 points.
Baked ribs with jack daniel sauce, pizza, grilled chicken wings, macaroni and cheese. Comes with a special salad with blue cheese. 9.75 points.

ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Family with small children, we were looking for a cozy space for dinner. Mr.C was just right. Delicious food, enthusiastic advice from the owner ^^"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"We actually wanted to try the breakfast offerings there. It was quite good. Unfortunately, there was a football match 🏈 or something similar on TV at the same time. It was a bit loud, so we left quickly after eating and paying. Good luck with your sports."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"I am a Vietnamese who works far away and comes home, I was walking along the beach and accidentally saw the restaurant, with a well-maintained oven, and I felt it would be delicious. We ordered a pizza and it was delicious, rich in flavor and I really liked the crust. The beers were also well priced, the space was comfortable, the waitress was very attentive and cheerful, she even turned on the fan for me, afraid we would be hot. The restaurant should have some country music, it would be more suitable and wonderful. Next time we go home, we will visit the pizza restaurant again."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Extremely delicious pizza. Going to Vung Tau, I was bored with seafood so I wandered around looking for a delicious pizza restaurant to change the taste and accidentally chose a super delicious restaurant. Pizza is baked in a charcoal oven. The crust is homemade by a Westerner so it is very crispy and soft. Rustic style and not the common dry crust like other types of pizza. In general, if you go to Vung Tau and are bored with seafood, you should try this restaurant. Guaranteed delicious pizza at a reasonable price. The only regret is that there is no parking space. But you can still park at a neighbor's house :))."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"The food was delicious! We had breakfast—an egg sandwich and a ham and cheese sandwich.
We'll be back for pizza!
The staff is still learning, so please be understanding."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Second time eating pizza here, the pizza is very delicious, very impressive, and it also comes with cold beer. Overall, I am impressed with the restaurant and will definitely visit again. Some small suggestions: 1. They should make many sizes of pizza because the pizza is so big that it can be eaten by 2 young people. 2. Because the pizza takes a long time to bake, the restaurant should have some snacks while waiting. 3. It would be even better if there was draft beer."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Delicious food, enthusiastic service, cute staff, clean food, airy space suitable for young people to try"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"The space is quite chill but sitting under the trees, sometimes there will be ""strange objects"" falling down. The food is handmade so it is very delicious and full. In my opinion, the price is quite cheap compared to the amount of food and the market, especially the pizza. Because I personally eat bland food, I find it a bit salty. The foreign owner seems to be from Canada, very quick and hospitable, the food is made by himself, the oven-baked pizza is very appealing."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"The owner goes to great lengths to make American-style (Australian?) pizzas over a wood-fired oven, despite the ambient heat. The prices are reasonable and the service is friendly."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"The space is airy, the owner is extremely friendly and always creates a happy and comfortable atmosphere for customers. The food here suits our group's taste very well, moreover, the portions are large, suitable for those with a healthy appetite or sharing with family/group of friends."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Pizza is delicious, not greasy, crispy crust because it is handmade right in the oven. The shop should sell snacks to eat while waiting for the pizza to bake. The space is quiet because not many people know about the shop, but I like it that way 🤣"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,The pizzas are so big. I couldn't finish them 😊
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Wood-fired pizza is the best
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,So delicious
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Best pizza in Vung Tau
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Best pizza in Vung Tau
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Staff sensational, Randy Tam and Vy"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Too many good vibes I don’t even know where to start
Talking about the food everything was just perfect. Everyone must try the pizza, smoked pork, and chicken wings, because the flavors are truly special not generic

As for the atmosphere, it was amazing. I’ve been to Vũng Tàu quite a few times, but this was my first time visiting this restaurant and it made this trip the most wonderful Vũng Tàu trip we’ve ever had. The guests were cheerful, and the staff and mr.C's were so friendly and welcoming.

mr.C's, he was wonderful! Very kind, attentive, and took great care of every customer. Maybe because we were having such a great time that day, he gave us extra delicious food and a cute little gift to take home.

This is definitely a place worth experiencing!"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Mr. C Bar in Vung Tau is a fantastic spot for anyone looking to enjoy cold drinks while catching up on sports. The atmosphere is lively and welcoming, making it the perfect place to relax with friends or family.

What truly stands out is the food. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are all exceptional, but you absolutely must try the wood-oven pizza’s. They’re perfectly cooked, with a delicious crust and fresh toppings that make each bite a treat. The menu offers a variety of options, ensuring there’s something for everyone.

Overall, Mr. C Bar is a must-visit destination in Vung Tau, combining great drinks, a vibrant sports vibe, and outstanding food. Highly recommended!"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Mr. C's now offering a great breakfast option with daily specials. A good alternative with all bacon, ham and sausage smoked and made on site. Super friendly staff and owner! And always playing current North American Sports! Lets go Blue Jays! Lets go Oilefs!"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Cozy, rustic, and welcoming place with delicious food — especially the grilled dishes!
The owner is super friendly, even gave my wife a gift, and made we feel right at home.
We stayed 3 days and 2 nights and had dinner here both nights — you should definitely try it!"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Pizzas r so delicious. The owner is friendly. If u need a place to eat n chill or to share stories, u better to come here. It’s perfect"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"This pizza makes me want to go back to Vũng Tàu again just for it. It’s too vibrant to be called a traditional Italian taste, and too light and wholesome to be considered the heavy American style. With plenty of onions and bell peppers, it strangely reminds me of the comforting flavors of a Korean mother’s cooking. The crust, baked in a wood-fired oven, is wonderfully crispy, and with each bite the rich vegetable juices from the generous onions and peppers fill my mouth—it’s absolutely delicious. I’m already planning to go back with my colleagues to enjoy it again."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Nice chilled place to go, pizza is great, cold beer and good service.  I definitely recommend to try here."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,The pizza is delicious. The owner is professional. The restaurant is clean. I love it. I highly recommend it.
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,Great place to come for ice cold beers and quality food and service... sports on TV and wood fire oven.. friendly locals too... I come back every time I am in vt.. thanks team 👌👏👍🍺🍕
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"What a great experience we had here. 2 years in a row, back to the same place, for drinks and a feed. Great atmosphere, great prices, even greater pizza!!! Thanks Randy and team for a wonderful few nights visiting Vung Tau, you made our stay so welcoming! Do not miss this place if you are in town!"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"What can I say. I've been coming to Vietnam for 15 years and lived here for 1 year in 2014. The Mr C Special Pizza 🍕 is the best I've had anywhere in VN and up there with pizzas back in Australia. Wood fired cooked just right. When I'm next in Vung Tau I will definitely come the Mr C's again. Oh yeah, cold beers 🍻 at a very reasonable price as well. Randy the owner and chef has done a great job with the bar..."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"We would take very serious the negative reviews, and in particular,  the responses from the owner, which we believe is everything that’s wrong.

The photo doesn’t lie... that pizza is blackened all around the edges. Not “charred” or “wood-fired rustic”, just burnt.

Burnt is burnt.

Go online and search for wood fired pizza from any reputable place in Vũng Tàu.

You’ll see blistered spots and a bit of darkening, not a crust that looks like charcoal. There’s a big difference between flavor from fire and flat out overcooking.

Even the other pizza pics from here look normal. Why so defensive?

That isn’t ""wood-fired flavor"", it’s a mistake that should have never left the kitchen.

Instead of apologizing and owning it, the owner blamed the customer.

They told them they should’ve asked questions before ordering, and that burnt is to be expected.

Crazy.

Then finishes with a patronizing “I hope my advice helps with your future dining experiences.”

That’s not accountability. That’s arrogance.

Geeze... Customers don’t need to interrogate a restaurant before placing an order. To look around and check the food.

They need a business that simply takes pride in its product.

Based on the owners' responses to negative reviews,  with that attitude, imagine what would have happened if the customers had said something when they were here.

Scary.

This is exactly why people speak up in reviews, because clearly, if they had spoken up in person, they’d have been dismissed just the same."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"AMAZING EXPERIENCE AND SERVICE
walked in met the staff then the patrons then the king of Vung Tau pizzas Mr C aka Randy I put high expectations out and he delivered"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"I didn’t except pizza so good in Vung Tau!
Randy has this friendly place with pizza oven where you feel like you are back home!
Pizza dough was spot on and homemade smoked meats were top tier!

7⭐️ out of 5!"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"I had a fantastic time! The pizza was delicious, and the beers were perfectly cold. The owner was really down-to-earth and great to chat with. Listening to the classic rock music was a joy; I could easily have stayed a couple more hours."
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"I love pizza at this restaurant.
It’s tasty and the price is reasonable"
ChIJ3_p2w21vdTERiu__GWjqg7w,"Terrific place to unwind and meet great friendly people. First class service with a frosty cold beer and am a Pizza cooked by the owner Randy. Best In town.
Very much worth a visit"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Great stay at Hafi Hotel Vũng Tàu!

I had a really pleasant experience here. The hotel is clean, modern, and very comfortable. The location is super convenient — just a short walk to the beach and close to many local food places and cafés. The staff were friendly and helpful throughout my stay.

The price was also very reasonable for what you get — great value compared to many other hotels in the area. The pool area was nice and relaxing, and the room had everything I needed. I would definitely recommend Hafi Hotel to anyone visiting Vũng Tàu, and I’ll be happy to come back again! 🌴"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"This hotel is just a 5-minute walk to the beach and offers reasonable prices. The rooms are clean, and although the staff don’t speak English, they are very friendly and welcoming.

However, the hotel restaurant was quite disappointing — the food was poorly prepared, and unfortunately, there are no other dining options nearby. We had to take a taxi into the city for every meal, which became quite inconvenient.

Tip for future guests: If you plan to stay here, consider bringing some food with you or arranging transport in advance for meals, as there are very limited options in the area."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"I randomly selected this hotel after an stress-filled day of traveling by motorbike.  I was in serious need of rest, and this hotel was the one nearest me.

The reception staff were kind and efficient at check-in.  My room was spacious and clean.  I spent two relaxing nights before  continuing on my cross-country travel (although I was tempted to stay a third: the bed was like resting on a cloud).  The water pressure and temp was excellent and I especially enjoyed the balcony access.

This hotel is new and the area surrounding it was in development during my stay.  Beach access is within walking distance (less than a 5 minute walk) and their onsite dining facilities provide a decent number of dishes from which to choose.

One note of mention - there was a moment of confusion during my stay.  The subject of the confusion is not significant, but what is significant is how the staff handled the matter.  Each staff member took time to listen and offer support within their capability.  Ultimately, the situation was resolved, and the staff were quite gracious in accepting responsibility in the situation.  They even discounted my second night's stay to apologize for the misunderstanding.  I am very appreciative of their approach to customer service and business management.

I will choose this hotel again the next time I travel to Vung Tau."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Nice hotel with loyal prices and friendly staff. Basically, local residents from other cities relax there on holidays and weekends. We were on holiday at the beginning of September, it was free, except for Vietnam Independence Day.

Good location. But if you don't plan to spend the whole day by the sea, you will need a means of transportation to get into town, such as a motobike. It's easy rent one in the town."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Clean and big room, quiet place for familt relaxing. Nice staffs. Highly recommend."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Fresch room and pool. The bed were lovely to live. The hotel staff is nice. It is only breakfast that will affect stars, it is limited to choose, one meal + drink is include in price and if you want get more, so you will pay extra."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"All new facilities, close to the beach, 20 minutes on bike to get to town"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,Ks ok
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,Talking very bad.  Not friendly
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Affordable price for family, nice location, the beach is quite dessert but clean."

ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"🌴 5-star rating for a great resort!
I was really satisfied after my stay here. The resort is clean, airy and close to the sea, extremely convenient for walking to watch the sunrise or swimming in the early morning.
💚 The staff, kitchen and security are all very cute, enthusiastic and friendly, always supporting guests thoughtfully.
🚗 Spacious and cool parking space, surrounded by coconut trees creating a feeling of relaxation, close to nature.
🍳 Delicious breakfast, diverse dishes and clean preparation. In any area, you can feel the absolute neatness and hygiene.
In short, the money spent is completely worth the quality of service and space here.
👉 I will definitely come back and recommend it to friends and relatives!"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"I didn't take a photo of the room because it was a bit messy, but the room was spacious like the advertised picture. My room had two balconies, price 850k from Saturday to Sunday, good soundproofing and a diverse breakfast buffet. The hotel has a swimming pool and the beach is about a 2-minute walk away. The beach at Long Cung tourist area is a bit far from the center so it is also deserted and quiet. Suitable for relaxation."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"I've really stopped worrying after following this hotel for years, when I saw the bad review, I was nervous but still decided to choose this hotel for my family's 3-day-2-night trip. 
Unlike the other review, the hotel is better than expected, spacious and clean. The staff is ok and pleasant, supporting me in everything. 
My baby just came out with a blanket and pillow, the hotel still supported enthusiastically, but I was also embarrassed. 
Although the breakfast is not as good as 4-star or 5-star, every dish is delicious, the refill is okay, there are not enough tables on weekends, sitting together is a bit awkward. But I think it's ok, that's enough food. As long as it's delicious, it's fine. 
As for the floor, it's true that it's wet, the hotel should add a mat or towel when entering the hotel from the pool or the beach to avoid getting the floor wet and then put it in the elevator, it looks a bit dirty and slippery. 
When I noticed the floor was a bit damp, I asked for an extra mat and the staff supported it ok. The garden and swimming pool are ok. Going to the beach is not too close if you walk. Kkkkkkk my legs are tired. But it's still fun. The beach is clean.
At night, if you go by car, you will return around 10pm when the street lights turn off at the Long Cung beach sign, so it will be a bit inconvenient to go by motorbike. Cars are ok.
Oh, the room has a sea view but the view is not very good because the trees cover it. It will be clearer on the 3rd floor, I'm on the 2nd floor kkkkk.
I hope Hafi will maintain this quality and develop more and more so that next time I can introduce more friends and continue to support the hotel when I have the opportunity to visit the back beach in Ho Chi Minh City! Wish all the staff good health."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"10đ no but.

The location of Long Cung beach is not noisy and bustling, very quiet but the view of the sea and the back beach.

The hotel has a large parking lot, the receptionist is quick and enthusiastic. The rooms are clean, fully equipped and have a very large balcony view. The breakfast is full and very delicious - especially the drinks are very delicious. Will support when there is a next opportunity because the price is worth the money."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"As a person working in the service industry, I had a quite peaceful and satisfying experience at Hafi. The room is clean, beautiful, fully equipped, the staff is very friendly, the area outside the hotel is quite large, parking is free, there is even a swimming pool, for children who cannot swim, there are staff to teach them how to swim. The hotel is also near the beach, only 5 minutes walk. Although the breakfast is a bit limited, it has all the basics such as drinks and fried eggs, quite impressive, although it is a small hotel, the juices are all made from fresh ingredients, not from canned products like some other big hotels. However, there are also some minus points such as the cleanliness of the hallways and stairs, the walkways are a bit dirty, the elevator is not clean because guests get wet from swimming in the sea and the pool, it is easy to slip and fall. The price is also reasonable if you do not have too high a demand for luxury or professionalism. It is worth the experience, I have tried it and will come back."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"My family just had a good experience at the hotel.
- Space: quiet, clean. There is a beach next to the hotel, the beach is quite private
- Location: 6-7 minutes drive from Thuy Van beach
- Interior: clean, simple decoration creates an airy feeling, has swimming pools for adults and children
- Spacious rooms, clean and beautiful toilets. The breakfast buffet has limited dishes but all the dishes are delicious.
A suitable place for those who like privacy, relaxation, and quiet."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The hotel is located in Long Cung beach area. This is a newly opened location and not in the center of Vung Tau but I like it. I don't like crowded places anymore. I stayed in a room with 2 corners overlooking the sea, the room was spacious and very clean, the hotel has a swimming pool. The staff is lovely from the security to the receptionist. The extra dish for 10k/stick is also very delicious. The buffet in the morning is also quite ok."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Great, I just had a vacation with my lover on June 1, 2025 at Hafi Hotel. 

The hotel is beautiful, luxurious, clean. The surrounding area is generally quiet, isolated from the outside, not a crowded, noisy residential area; the road is wide and airy. I booked a sup room with a street view at the cheapest price, but it was quite spacious and comfortable, not stuffy, with a cool balcony. 

The room is clean, neatly decorated, thick curtains to block the sun, when closed it is dark and cool. Big TV, Youtube, Netflix and other apps available. The refrigerator works well, really cold. The bed is very big, 4 people can lie down. The blanket is thick and warm. 

The bathroom is clean, drains quickly. 

Good soundproofing, I can't hear anything from the rooms next door, but I can still hear sounds from the hallway (small sound). That night, there was karaoke outside, so when you close the balcony door, you can't hear anything anymore, but when people shoot fireworks, you can still hear the popping sound of fireworks (very small). In short: you can hear the sound from the hallway, you can't hear the sound from the next room, the balcony is well soundproofed from the outside. 

The room price also includes a breakfast buffet ticket. The breakfast at the hotel is highly appreciated by my lover and me, quite delicious and clean. The main buffet line doesn't have too many dishes, only about 10 dishes, but all of them are delicious. There are mixed salads, cherry tomatoes and french fries, the french fries are not soggy and are very tasty. There are also many desserts, including fruits and jelly of all kinds. 

The shared swimming pool is large, the water is clean. There is a water tap for guests from the sea at the hotel gate. 

The two nearest beaches are Long Cung and Thuy Tien. I went to Thuy Tien beach, about 100m further than Long Cung, I didn't rent a seat, I just went down and swam. 

A bit far from the city center, about 10-15 minutes by motorbike into the city, in return the space is quiet, very chill, if you book a delux room or higher, there is a very beautiful sea view. When I booked early directly with the hotel via hotline, I also got a discount. 

The hotel staff, including the security guard who watches the car, are also very cute and enthusiastic. Vung Tau ice cream 10k is also very delicious, fragrant and rich in flavor, my lover really likes the matcha flavor. 

The trip at Hafi is worth the money, it will definitely be the place I think of when I want to come back."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The soundproofing is quite okay, the furniture in the room uses new technology so it is quite modern. However, the room uses yellow light so there is not enough light for the wife to do makeup. Anyone with a wife or girlfriend should bring a lamp. The service is attentive and there is additional support. Very enthusiastic."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Good place for families or couples on weekdays. Prices are a bit high on weekends. The hotel has a small swimming pool and is very close to the beach. This area is very quiet. In general, those who like quiet can choose to rest."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The room is beautiful and worth the price (I went on a weekday and applied 7749 discount codes to 500k/room), and you guys upgraded my room to a suit (2 balconies)
The service is super good, there is a delicious buffet breakfast at the line counter and lots of food.
The reception staff are very enthusiastic. We checked out but left our luggage, then came back to get our luggage and asked to borrow the bathroom to shower again. They were still ok and did not charge any extra fee ❤️

There is one minus point, the mirror in the room, it's weird and I get dizzy when looking in it, so I didn't SF in front of the mirror even though the room is very beautiful, spacious and airy 💕

Thank you guys for giving me a very worthy trip, after the hustle and bustle of work ❤️
See you guys next time, I will definitely come back"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The hotel is ok, convenient for families, a bit far from the city, quiet area, rooms with windows open to the sea.
Breakfast has delicious crab noodle soup.
The swimming pool is ok, clean water, no smell.
Parking in the hotel, spacious."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"This is in the outskirts of Vung Tau, Long Cung section.
The hotel does not have a sea view, so if you want a sea view, this is not the right choice.
I want to stay in a quiet place so I chose to stay here, a bit far but comfortable.
There is a breakfast buffet, the food is okay, not many dishes but overall it is okay.
The staff is cute and enthusiastic.
Clean.
The only downside is that the toilet paper is only 1 roll :)))) if there is still a little bit of water, it would be better to leave a whole roll as a spare."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"This is the second time I have stayed at Hafi. The hotel is okay, but it is near other villa rental houses so it will be noisy at night. In addition, the location is quite inconvenient if you take a bus because many buses will not transfer to this Long Cung area."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The hotel is very clean, the room has a very nice sea view, delicious breakfast, spacious parking, very reasonable price, but the distance to the center is a bit far, the resort is very ok"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Going in the low season so the price is quite ok
A la carte breakfast is ok
Near Long Cung beach
Swimming pool is ok
However, I am not very satisfied with the room, the room was not cleaned properly, the floor still had a lot of sand, the mattress was also sandy, I don't know if it will be replaced"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"This place is far from the center, but from the service to the quality of the rooms and food, it's 10 points. Enthusiastic, warm, hospitable, well-seasoned and the food portion is so full that you can't breathe 🥹 100 points !!!"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Great hotel, great staff. The hotel is located on a wide road, easy to move around, and has a lot of parking. Friendly and enthusiastic staff. When booking on the app, I booked a small room, but when I checked in, the hotel upgraded me to a larger room for free. New facilities. Will come back if I have the chance."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The hotel is clean, spacious, the room is exactly as shown on agoda. I arrived early and was still supported to check in. The staff was enthusiastic. The breakfast buffet was also delicious and filling. However, the location is a bit far from the center. The air conditioner will not be as cold as other places, my room also has a fan. But I think it's okay. I will come back next time."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Going out with friends and staying at Hafi - so good! The hotel is clean, quiet, airy. The room is spacious, has a cool balcony, super big bed. Full amenities, good soundproofing, great for watching movies.

Delicious, quality breakfast buffet. Clean swimming pool, near the sea. Friendly, enthusiastic staff.

In short: worth the money, great for chilling with a group of friends, will definitely come back!"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"I went with 2 people for this trip, the staff at Hafi were friendly, the rooms were clean so my friend slept all night and didn't want to go anywhere and the breakfast was delicious.
Every corner in Hafi is beautiful for checking in and taking virtual photos.
Although it's far from the center, my friend and I really like it because we don't want noise. It's only 10 minutes to the city."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Advantages: cheap room, location near the sea. 2 minutes walk to the sea. Clean and beautiful beach, swimming pool under the hotel. Friendly and lovely staff.

Disadvantages:
1. The room light is very dim, very uncomfortable for the eyes.
2. The room soundproofing is extremely bad. You can hear the conversation outside. Especially when going to the bathroom outside, you can hear no sound.
3. The breakfast buffet has few dishes, not delicious, overall bad (suitable for the price).
4. The swimming pool is small, not beautiful (suitable for the price).
In general, I will not come back."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Hotel near the sea, airy and spacious. Looks new from the outside but the furniture in the room is not nice. Suitable for the price. Breakfast is enough, not too many dishes. Friendly and enthusiastic staff."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Stayed at the hotel for the third time with my family, very good experience. New hotel, clean and beautiful rooms, modern facilities. My family also got a free room upgrade from the hotel. A small minus point is that the breakfast buffet on weekdays has fewer dishes than on weekends, the food is still delicious."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Polite staff, clean and airy rooms, swimming pool for children to enjoy. But the public beach is difficult to get to and the sea is not very clean."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"I am a customer who directly experienced the service, not a clone or a “karma creator” as the hotel implied. It is really surprising that instead of listening to suggestions to improve, the hotel counted the number of 1-star reviews I had written elsewhere to attack me personally. 

I have traveled a lot, experienced a lot, I am very fair in praising good places, and I reflect the reality of weak places. If the hotel thinks that anyone who dares to give feedback is “creating karma”, then they should STOP providing the service. Because of providing services, if you are afraid of being criticized, like to be praised, and do not accept the truth, then there is a problem. 

I do not need to be “forgiven” as the hotel wrote, because I did nothing wrong. What I reflected was the truth I witnessed with my own eyes: dirty rooms, poor hygiene, unprofessional staff, impolite attitude towards guests – and now there is also disrespectful and uncivilized feedback from the management. 

Thanks for confirming why customers are losing trust. With this kind of reaction, whether it is 1 star or 100 stars, I will continue to share the truth, so that other consumers can know and make the right choice.
Guest: Pham Thoai"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The hotel is a bit far from the center but the rooms are spacious, modern, clean, the staff is enthusiastic and cute, the beach is only about 100m away. There is a breakfast buffet. There is a swimming pool but during peak hours it is a bit crowded, there are few lights in the room. In short, I am very satisfied! Give the hotel 5 stars"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Beautiful room, full amenities, fast elevator, no need to wait like The Song
Affordable price, book 1 week in advance and get 10% discount, enthusiastic staff, unlimited mineral water in the fridge for only 10k fee, and free breakfast at the hotel when booking. 11 points."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"My family had dinner here, the waiters were very nice and recommended the dishes to the guests very appropriately. The food in the 2-night set was enough for 3 people to eat, delicious, fresh, enthusiastic service for individual guests like my family even though the restaurant had a group of guests having dinner at that time. Any family who goes on vacation to Hafi does not need to go anywhere to find food, but if you are staying at nearby resorts such as Long Cung, The Aria, Villa areas, just come to Hafi to try, the service is extremely good."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Stayed here twice, very ok, the breakfast buffet is delicious. However, if you go during the week, the swimming pool is used as a swimming class, so hotel guests have no place to swim. Otherwise, it's great. The last meal I stayed for 4 days was great."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Recommend for families with small children and traveling by car. The restaurant serves reasonably priced and delicious dishes. My family always has lunch here at noon, which is very convenient. Because we have a small child, my family doesn't have much need to visit, we mostly stay in the hotel and go to the nearby beach to swim. Will come back again."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"I booked a room on a weekday, the price for a 3-person room is 1 million, a single room is 600k. Breakfast is included. I booked 1 day in advance so I got a 10% discount. I arrived early so I waited until almost 1 o'clock to check in. The room was clean and fully equipped."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,Everything is satisfactory except for having a swimming center with a pool. The pool is too small so guests can't swim comfortably. The hotel shouldn't rent out pools like that.
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The staff helped me upgrade to a room with a super nice view and spacious, the breakfast was delicious, especially the pasta, the staff also took care of me enthusiastically, I told them if I ran out of food they refilled it immediately"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The room is very clean, the owner and staff are very nice. In front of the hotel there is also a delicious ice cream shop."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The room is spacious, clean, has a swimming pool, the location is near the beach, very convenient. The breakfast buffet is delicious 👌👌👌"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"- Room: Overall, it's still clean and a bit new, the bathroom is also relatively clean, the room is cleaned very clean before check-in, the ladies clean meticulously
- Service: the receptionists are enthusiastic, let you check in early if there is a vacant room, the dining area is ok although there are a few dishes, the price is a bit high
- Food: the ladies cook delicious, clean
- Location: near Long Cung area, on Ha Huy Tap street, 300m walk from the beach, the beach in this area is not clean
- Swimming pool area: too crowded, the swimming pool is small, there are also local swimming instructors so it's very crowded

=> Personal opinion: Suitable for family vacations"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The room is very nice, the staff is enthusiastic, the food is delicious, the view is nice, the location is not too far from the center, the stone is very smooth"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The old toilet was dark and rundown. The housekeeping staff put their slippers straight into the living room. When asked, they replied that they had always cleaned the room like this. What's wrong with cleaning? After staying for 2 nights, the floor was full of dirty sand and dirt every day. The room wasn't clean. The attitude from the staff to the security guard was terrible. They didn't talk to the guests with any subject or predicate. The breakfast buffet was poor, cold, and uninteresting."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The hotel service is very attentive, enthusiastic, and supportive. My company organized a party and the hotel supported us completely. If there is a chance, we will support again next time."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Delicious breakfast, clean room and cool view, swimming pool, near the beach, ok service, enthusiastic staff,"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Lovely staff, free room upgrade
Bedroom ok
The bathroom is a bit dark and not very clean, lots of calcium deposits, I'm on the 3rd floor."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The hotel is nice, very clean and the staff are enthusiastic, the hospital is very cute and there is also delicious ice cream."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The staff here are very enthusiastic. I was upgraded to a room with a pretty good sea view
The room is fully furnished and has an umbrella so you can walk to the beach without being exposed to the sun. The TV can screen from the Mac to watch movies, which is also good
The location is a bit far from the center so it's very quiet and it's reasonable to change places to meet deadlines
Big clean swimming pool
The breakfast portion is good and delicious
The road leading in is under construction so it's a bit bad"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The food is quite delicious and tasty, the rooms are nice and spacious, I am quite satisfied with the quality of the services
Will come back when going to Vung Tau 🥰"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Clean hotel, affordable price, enthusiastic and attentive staff"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The hotel is clean, quiet, good soundproofing and beautifully decorated, 100m from the beach (Thuy Tien beach is clean, clear and the water is warm). The staff is friendly and enthusiastic, the air conditioner is cold and the breakfast buffet is okay, but far from the city center, worth the experience."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"I visited Hafi Hotel and stayed for 2 nights for my vacation. The hotel is airy and spacious, the staff from the reception, service and security are all cute and enthusiastic with customers. My room is clean and fully equipped for guests. The breakfast here is delicious, I also got a free dessert plate. Except for the fact that it is a bit far from the center, everything is okay."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The rooms and service are quite good, most of the rooms are new and nicely decorated. The breakfast buffet is okay, some hot dishes like vermicelli soup, fried eggs, crab soup... are mostly clean and tidy. The hotel has a swimming pool in the back which is also clean and has a swimming area for children. The only downside is that it is a bit far from the beach, when I went, the sea was rough so I had to go back to the center to swim at the back beach, in addition, the switch in the room with two large beds and one single bed is quite inconvenient, because if you turn off one switch, all the lights in the room will turn off. The staff is friendly and the room is quite quiet."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Initially I booked a Superior room but the hotel upgraded it to a Deluxe room. I really love the hotel. The room is very clean, airy, and at this price, it has a balcony and includes breakfast, which is great ❤️"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The staff is very nice, supporting all my requests. I booked a sup room of 25m2 and the hotel upgraded me to a deluxe room of 32m2, which is more spacious. New furniture, clean swimming pool. Except for being a bit far from the center (15 minutes by motorbike), there is nothing to complain about."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Great experience at Hafi
🌼location:
- not too far from the central area, about 10 minutes by car. This area is under construction so it is quite sad at night and lacks street lights. However, the opposite side of the street is bustling so you can go there to eat and drink at night.
- Near the beach so it takes 2-3 minutes to walk to the beach. This area is new so it is still clean, the sea water is clear enough to see small fish swimming, and there are no street vendors to attract customers.

🌼 Space: spacious, airy, true to the resort style - relax. The white tone looks luxurious, the room is clean and fully equipped. In the lobby there is a dining area and a very convenient toilet. The parking lot is spacious and the security guard has a car card so it is very secure.

🌼 Amenities:
- There is a swimming pool that can be used comfortably when staying here, the pool is clean and there are always people watching when guests go swimming (lifeguards and guests support). There is a separate staircase for guests to go to their rooms if they don't want to go to the main lobby of the hotel if they are wet.
- Because the hotel only has 3 floors, the elevator is very fast and there are 2 elevators. The elevator is also wide and clean
- Delicious breakfast, enthusiastic and thoughtful service
- The receptionist is cheerful and enthusiastic in supporting guests when asked
- The security guard is cheerful and always greets guests every time I take my car in and out

🌼 Price: reasonable, if you book early, you will get a discount. I booked directly with the hotel so the price is better than on the apps

🌸 Disadvantages:
- Due to the construction, the gate has a sandbank that is very difficult to run on and I almost fell here, hopefully the repair will be completed soon or a few bricks will be placed to make driving easier.
- The area right at the entrance is a wardrobe and a mirror, but both lights are not on because they are sensor lights so there is no switch, so the area is dark, going out is dark, the room is dark, I can't do makeup or take pictures because it's dark. When I go to the toilet, I get wet and can't stand in there to do makeup. I hope the hotel will consider supporting to fix the light right at the entrance. 

❤️❤️❤️ In short, I will come back many times 😂"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Clean and bright rooms
Friendly staff, quick receptionist, easy to talk to
10 points!"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The room is nice and clean, there is a clean swimming pool, but it's not too big. Walk to the beach about 10 minutes"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"I was sad because at first I booked on a fake page, the page said it was a real hotel. Consulting, closing the deal. Even when I said I would go down to the site to check, then that Page texted me asking if I had gone down yet and was waiting. I almost transferred the deposit. And this gg Maps is the official page, everyone. Please click on the phone number on the page to call or find the hotel's website."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The hotel is located near Long Cung beach, has a clean swimming pool. The day I went around, the roads were being renovated so it was quite messy. The service was quite good compared to the price, the room was spacious, clean, with 3-star amenities. 
There was a small problem when checking in but the receptionist later resolved it for my family. Triple room for 4 people on the weekend costs 1020k including buffet breakfast. 

8/10 for this experience"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Beautiful hotel, delicious food, clean rooms, enthusiastic support staff 🤍"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Clean rooms, friendly staff. Very close to the beach, convenient for those who like to swim without having to go far.

Breakfast is a bit slow. Hopefully next time I use this service, the breakfast buffet will be better."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Very good experience here.
From consulting service, to booking a room, all are attentive and polite. The space is spacious, airy, fully equipped, behind is the sea, there is also a swimming pool - most of the time there is support,... The breakfast buffet is delicious, filled quickly, enough for the weekend because it doesn't arrive until 8:20 but still has a full experience.
The downside is that it is a bit far from the center, with the area still under construction, the road is bad, a bit inconvenient to move around. Booked in a hurry on the weekend so couldn't book a room with a sea view, then a corner view, weekend 900k (with 10% discount - including breakfast buffet), compared to that it is reasonable (even cheap).
A small minus point is that the car rental is bad, the Wave is a plow-style car, driving is also worried about falling off :))"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Good customer service, the staff is very cute and enthusiastic. The room is comfortable with a cool balcony, clean bedding, and beautiful decor. I am very happy because the 2 nights here were comfortable, the staff who received us had nothing to complain about. If I have the opportunity to return to Vung Tau, I will definitely come back here."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"- The room is very spacious, clean, simple but just enough.
- The breakfast buffet is quite delicious.
- I like the hotel's 2 separate electric and room keys so the room is still cool when I return.
- The swimming pool is super large.
- The staff is enthusiastic and cute.
- The location is far from the center so it is a bit inconvenient for families with small children to travel.
- I had an unpleasant experience when the hotel's rental car broke down in the middle of the road, forcing me to walk a distance, but the owner apologized sincerely and resolved the matter very well. When I returned to Saigon, the staff informed me that I had forgotten my clothes and even enthusiastically shipped them back to me for free. I highly appreciate this point.
=> In short, I think this is a hotel worth staying at when visiting Vung Tau."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Clean, airy rooms, enthusiastic and comfortable staff"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The price, quality and service of the hotel are suitable. Near the beach so easy to walk. The beach is not as crowded as Thuy Van beach so comfortable. There is breakfast when renting a room."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The hotel room is beautiful and clean. The staff is super enthusiastic and cute. Although the surrounding scenery has a city view, it is quiet and has good security. Hope the hotel always maintains its reputation, will come back here many more times."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,Nice clean room great service
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"I got a free upgrade to a larger room, everything is very ok, everyone"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The restaurant staff here are very enthusiastic and attentive, chubby, the breakfast is delicious, kkk, and the receptionist is also very cute, early check-in and free room upgrade, simple and beautiful room decoration. I really like it and will come back
only the entrance is bad, and the wifi signal is weak, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"HAFI I often stay in Vung Tau starting from 2020. After many years, the rooms are still beautiful, not much degraded, clean. The staff from the security guard to the receptionists are all very nice. I will still choose to stay here if I go to Vung Tau. This time I stayed, the wifi was a bit bad so I had to fix it."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Large room, reasonable price, convenient walk to the beach, good soundproofing, I stayed in a corner room with many doors so during the day the room was as bright as I wanted, the hallway when guests went swimming or going to the beach had water stains, but cleaning was a bit slow so the hallway looked a bit sticky.
The psychology department gives 2 cards, 1 card to attach to the electrical outlet to keep the air conditioner running to cool the room and 1 card to access the door. In the evening, the lights are just enough to chill, there aren't many lights and the lights are yellow so it's a bit dark. The area is large so the windows are very cool and windy.
The toilet is okay, using dark tone tiles + few lights so the toilet is dark, the toiletries have a lot of calcium residue, at first glance it's clean but if you look closely, it's not very clean. Need to improve cleaning the toilet as well as change the lights a little brighter, that would be great. There is a buffet breakfast but I didn't eat it so I don't know how it tastes, but the restaurant prepares very fragrant food.
The location is about 15-20 minutes drive from the center of Vung Tau, so you should have a car or private car to pick you up. In return, this area is quiet. Although there are a few villas for rent that sing in the evening, they are not too noisy, just enough to rest."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Only 150m from the public beach (2-minute walk)
- Campus of more than 3000m2 with cool green coconut trees
- Outdoor swimming pool of 180m2 (with children's pool)
- All rooms have airy balconies.
- Spacious and comfortable parking
- Large yard for parties (BBQ, Birthday, Gala, Year-end party ...)
- Indoor restaurant with capacity of 120 guests
- Room rates from 600K including breakfast and swimming pool use
- Suitable for family vacations

- Cute small hotel combined with Tea and Coffee shop (Quality drinks at reasonable prices). - Opposite the sea and public beach (30m)

- Sea view from the terrace at sunset is very beautiful. - Modern and dynamic design, an ideal place for young people to check in"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The hotel is very beautiful, beautiful inside and out, the staff is cheerful, the swimming pool has umbrellas so it's less sunny, the breakfast buffet is delicious, in general there's nothing to complain about except the road to the hotel is under construction so it's a bit ugly."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Attentive service, very professional staff. I only had the opportunity to interact with the receptionist and the security guard. Thank you very much for the enthusiasm and thoughtfulness of the staff here. This is a place I will definitely come back to relax."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Nice clean room, delicious food, friendly staff. Been there many times"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,My family had a great experience here.
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"New room, clean. The reception desk did not turn on the air conditioner, it was quite hot for guests checking in at noon in August. The location is near Long Cung beach, but the beach location has many domestic water discharge pipes, 6-7km from the center of Vung Tau, close to Chi Linh kdc and sealink, dic phoenix so it is ok to eat and drink."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The price is excellent, the room was clean and spacious, with a balcony, and the breakfast was delicious. The hotel has its own small swimming pool, and the beach is only a 5-minute walk away. However, it is a little far from the bustling city center, so walking would be a bit tiring. Renting a scooter would be a good option for getting around."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"A bit far from the center, but the room is very ok, the service is very ok, friendly and enthusiastic, easy to consult, the buffet has enough dishes, breakfast is also enough but the taste is not really to my taste. Comfortable car park, clean swimming pool, enthusiastic pool staff, I asked to rent swimming goggles and he lent me for free. The security guard who watches the car day and night is also cute, the elevator is ok, the restroom is clean, new, and beautiful. Will come back if I have the chance."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Room quality 👍 is good. Minimalist style, gray is the main color so it feels comfortable when entering the room!
The staff is also cute!
Just try to improve housekeeping so that hidden details like behind the sink and toilet are cleaner!
There is a car park.
Sunset 🌅 from balcony 10/10"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"I booked a sup room, but was upgraded to a super room, with a pool view, a larger and more beautiful room. Supported by the sup room price. The room is clean, far from the city, quiet, suitable for relaxation near the beach. A great experience"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The first time I experienced HAFI on a weekday, there weren't many guests, only 1 or 2 families, but I liked the feeling, isolated and quiet, I really liked the swimming pool (so big) and the enthusiastic staff here. This is a real compliment, not seeding. But it's a bit far from the city, if you don't want to go far, book a room in Ha Long near the front and back beaches."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Clean room, enthusiastic and attentive staff. I really like staying here, it feels very comfortable like at home. Although I don't check in until 2am, I arrived a bit early and was still supported to check in early without any extra charge, I love it. Now, if you become a loyal customer and book a room, you will get an additional discount. 10 VND"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Spacious, clean room, reasonable price. Receptionist is enthusiastic and quick. Can book room via app so convenient."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Nice, spacious and clean room. Attentive and enthusiastic staff. Great view but reasonable price."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Nice location. The view is quite good, the rooms are clean and airy. Enthusiastic staff and reasonable prices"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Great hotel, reasonable price
- Large swimming pool, clean beach, not too crowded
-Most impressive is the breakfast buffet, delicious and many dishes
- Spacious rooms, with balcony
The distance from the center is about 5km. Does not affect entertainment in the center ^^"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Near the beach but the room is not very good, the staff is friendly and cute, the pool security guard seems a bit impolite, but not to me, I saw him reminding the other female guest and shouting a bit loudly, I thought I should go closer to remind her, the shouting startled me, I don't know if he had any bad intentions or not."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"I was really impressed and extremely happy because I met the friendly Vung Tau people and the hotel was absolutely perfect for my ideas. Everything was great, from the receptionist to my room being upgraded, I was able to check in early on weekdays around 11am, the staff were very nice. If I have the opportunity to go to VT again, I will definitely choose Hafi hotel as my resort."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Great, comfortable. The owner is funny and friendly."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Clean room, enthusiastic and attentive staff. Really like staying here, feels very comfortable like at home. Will come back when I have the chance."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"The hotel is very ok, the security guard is enthusiastic, the receptionists are very friendly and cheerful, I asked to find anything, they helped me, the hotel is near the beach, walk 200m to watch the sunrise, very beautiful, at night you can walk to the beach, there is a parking lot for cars, there is a swimming pool, in general very satisfied, a little far from the center, otherwise perfect"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Beautiful hotel, attentive service, super nice view, 10 stars"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Everyone, the hotel is clean. Near the beach. Recommended to stay."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"I accidentally chose HAFI and when I entered the room, I really liked it. The room was simple but beautiful, especially clean, the toilet was also clean, the exhaust fan was good so it was not damp and had no smell. I accidentally broke the ceramic shampoo bottle but HAFI did not charge extra. The service was very good. If you need anything, just call and it will be available immediately. The swimming pool was also extremely clean, there were also some inflatable toys which were fun. The breakfast buffet had few dishes but was delicious, with lots of fruit. In general, 100 VND, next time I go to VT, I will come to HAFI again."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Luxury, clean, new hotel
The location is a bit far from the center but in return it is very quiet and comfortable.
The staff is cheerful and enthusiastic, especially the security guard is very friendly.
The hotel pillows are made from high-quality cotton, very soft.
The food at the hotel is especially delicious.
The swimming pool is large, clean, and safe"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"I just had one stay here. I didn't plan to book too far from the center, but when I came here to experience it, everything was very thoughtful compared to the price.
1) About price: the price is quite good compared to the central price of 600k/room or more (weekly price).
-I booked 2 rooms at Tet price:
Room P306- 2 ​​beds 1 million
Room 201- 1 bed 1 million
-All rooms have large balconies.
The above price includes discount, early booking with breakfast buffet + 1 additional baby (about 200k/night)
2) The location is quite quiet, the view is not directly facing the sea but the view is quite good, 200m down to the sea, next to Long Cung resort and The Aria resort Vung Tau. This area is full of villas so it is not as crowded as the front beach, suitable for those who like quiet.
But the bend from the main road to the hotel has no traffic lights, so you have to be careful when crossing
3) Good facilities, all made of wood, new rooms, clean, but the wait for hot water is a bit long, probably due to the use of solar energy, hidden ceiling air conditioners for all rooms, 60 inch TV, sofa, large toilet, swimming pool behind the hotel, clean. Around the house is well kept, no trash thrown around
And note that when you check in, check all the equipment from hot water, air conditioning, toilet sensor lights, umbrellas, TV remotes, etc.... everything is still enough and working well. If there is any problem, report it to the receptionist immediately because everything is regulated into money. If lost or damaged, compensation will be made according to the hotel's rules, which is easy to understand.
4) Service: I highly appreciate the service here is very good, the staff from the receptionist to the staff members are all warm, polite and pleasant. Everything responds very quickly.
5) The breakfast buffet doesn't have many dishes, but the kitchen makes it very suitable for your taste.
Family meals are very delicious, a set of rice for 2 adults + 1 child costs about 200k-300k (not including the 20% Tet surcharge and VAT, but I find the price still more reasonable than eating out in terms of quality and price.
Or eat alacarte as you like for 50k-180k/dish
Coffee: 20k-30k
Beer is the same price outside, sometimes cheaper
I think the price of seafood here is also good because I went down to Long Son floating raft to eat crabs for about 880k/kg, size 5 is also expensive and Thanh Phat Seafood is also somewhere the same price as Hafi, Hafi is 1 million/kg but size 2-3 so that price is also ok.
In short, in my opinion, if you rent a room near the center and have breakfast on your own, I think this place has a pretty good cost for 1 night, not too expensive, with good amenities and services that are worth choosing for your own vacation and your family.
I evaluate objectively according to my feelings.
Thank you Hafi and I hope you always maintain such quality."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"Great stay at Hafi Hotel Vũng Tàu!

I had a really pleasant experience here. The hotel is clean, modern, and very comfortable. The location is super convenient — just a short walk to the beach and close to many local food places and cafés. The staff were friendly and helpful throughout my stay.

The price was also very reasonable for what you get — great value compared to many other hotels in the area. The pool area was nice and relaxing, and the room had everything I needed. I would definitely recommend Hafi Hotel to anyone visiting Vũng Tàu, and I’ll be happy to come back again! 🌴"
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"This hotel is just a 5-minute walk to the beach and offers reasonable prices. The rooms are clean, and although the staff don’t speak English, they are very friendly and welcoming.

However, the hotel restaurant was quite disappointing — the food was poorly prepared, and unfortunately, there are no other dining options nearby. We had to take a taxi into the city for every meal, which became quite inconvenient.

Tip for future guests: If you plan to stay here, consider bringing some food with you or arranging transport in advance for meals, as there are very limited options in the area."
ChIJ36fOuEpwdTER1B47OgDYG4U,"I randomly selected this hotel after an stress-filled day of traveling by motorbike.  I was in serious need of rest, and this hotel was the one nearest me.

The reception staff were kind and efficient at check-in.  My room was spacious and clean.  I spent two relaxing nights before  continuing on my cross-country travel (although I was tempted to stay a third: the bed was like resting on a cloud).  The water pressure and temp was excellent and I especially enjoyed the balcony access.

This hotel is new and the area surrounding it was in development during my stay.  Beach access is within walking distance (less than a 5 minute walk) and their onsite dining facilities provide a decent number of dishes from which to choose.

One note of mention - there was a moment of confusion during my stay.  The subject of the confusion is not significant, but what is significant is how the staff handled the matter.  Each staff member took time to listen and offer support within their capability.  Ultimately, the situation was resolved, and the staff were quite gracious in accepting responsibility in the situation.  They even discounted my second night's stay to apologize for the misunderstanding.  I am very appreciative of their approach to customer service and business management.

I will choose this hotel again the next time I travel to Vung Tau."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"Full 5*! Had such a great breakfast here with noodle soup, tofu and seaweed soup, and Viet fresh spring rolls. The ambiance is fine, but not the focus, so I gave it a 5* as well just because there should not be a distraction from this great food!
Thank you also for the great service, very fast and kind staff!"

ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"Quiet atmosphere, simple menu, cheap prices and good food. Only downside is the work being done out the front as it smells. But once inside you can’t smell it."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"A very good and well priced vegan restaurant. One thing that you wanna be aware of before coming in is the smell of the pond/lake right next to this place, which is pretty bad and you can still smell it while eating at this place, so if you are smell sensitive, you probably wanna avoid here. As for the food, I liked the braised mushrooms especially."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"A great restaurant tucked away just off a main road. The owners used to run a restaurant in HCMC, and it shows in the level of quality, which is clearly a cut above the average in Vung Tau.

We had the fresh springrolls, rice vermicelli soup, lemongrass chili tofu and the delightful lime and mushroom salad, which was probably my favorite.

I recommend anyone, vegetarian, vegan or otherwise to give this place a try!"
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"I used Grab delivery several times for veggie food from this place while staying in Vung Tau. Very decent portions, tasty and delicious food. I recommend raw veggie spring rolls 💚 Was pleased to try out mushrooms served along with most of the dishes. Thank you 🙏🏻 Com on 🫶"
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"I ordered tofu with mushrooms and broccoli with oyster sauce. The food was good, but the portions were really small. I guess for the price, that’s expected. The rice was a bit hard, probably because it was left in the rice cooker too long. Overall, it wasn’t anything special."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"The phnom penh noodle soup was the most delicious vegetarian noodle i ever had. My partner order the ""my duc soya noodle stir fry was also nice accompanied by the chilli oil. The lemongrass chilli tofu was soft n crispy on the outside. Great service staff and the ambiance was great. The food is great and affordable. 6:30am to 8pm."

ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"If you're living in the Melody apartment area and craving vegetarian food, this restaurant is a must-try. I recently discovered it during a rainy day and was pleasantly surprised.

I ordered the bun bo chay and it was absolutely delicious. Unfortunately, I was so eager to enjoy it that I forgot to take a photo before finishing. The prices are also very reasonable, making it a great option for a satisfying vegetarian meal. Highly recommended!"
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,A real vegetarian and vegan gem in Vung Tau. (The only non-vegan thing i could see on the menu was yoghurt.) The food is delicious and the menu is wide-ranging. The staff are really lovely. The prices are extremely low and there's free green tea with ginger. I ate here every day during my stay in Vung Tau. Highly recommended.
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"A nice simple vegetarian chay restaurant. The food was super tasty and very well priced. Under $3AUD or 45,000VND

Unbelievable prices.
Shopee orders are okay."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"I really enjoyed dining here. It's a family restaurant run with passion and a smile.

It's only open weekdays and they rent out the space for home stays on the weekends.

The owners are generous and helpful. They helped us search (and successfully located) a vegetarian street food in town.

This restaurant is just getting started. They ran a successful spot in HCMC, but returned home to be closer to extended family.

The spot is located just a short distance from a main Street along a lake. It's quiet there."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,Nicely decorated restaurant with good food and friendly owners;)  I had a great chat with the owner  about buddhism;) the restaurant is located in a quiet area next to the  lake. So you can relax and enjoy your food;)

ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"I'm not vegetarian nor vegan, and I generally stay away from this kind of places in my own country, because they often offer blander tastes for higher prices. But traveling throughout Vietnam has thought me that this isn't true everywhere. This place is a perfect example of a vegetarian gem, where everything taste amazing, the service is kind, the ambience nice and the prices very reasonable. Definitely a place to try in Vũng Tàu."

ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"Delicious food, soft rice grains, fragrant mushrooms, crispy fried ribs, hot soup, rich flavor, gentle and cute owner, everyone come eat and support the restaurant."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"Super delicious, fast food, enthusiastic staff, highly recommended"
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"Family vegetarian restaurant, located in a modest location in an alley.

The food is normal, not too special. Quite clean. The menu is not very diverse. The spring rolls are not delicious, the sauce is strange and not suitable.

The restaurant space is also simple, few tables. Cheap and popular with many foreigners."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"I ate 1 mixed rice and a bowl of jute mallow soup, delicious, clean, and the staff was friendly too."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"The vegetarian restaurant is located by the lake, air-conditioned. There is a 16-car parking space outside. The first time I ate there, I was surprised because the price of the food was only 35-40K but the quality was beyond my expectations. There was also free iced tea. Hot pot was around 200K. If I have a chance to go to Vung Tau, I will come back."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"My wife and I are both vegetarians.

We have eaten at many restaurants, but when we come here, the feeling is really new...
The food is very delicious, not too bland, not too strong..... sweet taste, suitable for vegetarians to enjoy and experience ❤❤❤❤
Especially the owner is very enthusiastic and cheerful👌"
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"The food is so delicious that I forget to take pictures every time I come. Natural vegetarian food, delicious broth. The owners are friendly and cute. The restaurant is right in the center, the decoration is chill
Every time I go to VT, I stop by to eat, in general, I love it and the price is reasonable"
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"The dry noodles are delicious! I haven't tried the other dishes yet, but I'll come back when I have the chance!"
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"The restaurant is in a large alley, opposite a lake which is quite cool in the afternoon. Reasonable price for a tourist area, delicious food, clean, polite and quiet, the owner asks and understands the customers' wishes well."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"Delicious, light food with lots of toppings. This will be my vegetarian place every time I come to Vung Tau."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"Cute and small restaurant, the owner is cute and enthusiastic. The food is delicious, the price is very reasonable. You should try it."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"My family is always loyal to Chinese spinach soup, braised tofu with mushrooms, stir-fried morning glory with garlic, and banana flower salad. Every dish is delicious."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"Very delicious vegan and vegetarian dishes. We went there with our two children and received a very warm welcome. We had six different dishes, all of which were delicious. Our total bill was 250,000 dong, which was an absolutely reasonable price for the amount.
The restaurant is somewhat tucked away on a side street, so it's pleasantly quiet."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"This is my first time here, the food is delicious. The dish I had was mixed rice. The owner is cute, the restaurant is clean and quiet."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"Delicious restaurant, comfortable and cool space
The price is also very reasonable, delicious, quality
I really like this restaurant

ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,Delicious rice. Friendly and cheerful owner.
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"Been here 3 days in a row now, tried different things, everything was delicious! Friendly staff who spoke to me directly! Right on the lake! Highly recommend it!🤩"
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"A choice for vegetarians.

Delicious restaurant with spacious parking.
Long-term rental rooms available."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"Recommend everyone to order mixed rice, mixed noodles and hotpot with fermented bean curd here 😊😊 cheap but good quality"
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"Delicious
Clean
Good Price"
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"Visited the shop once by chance. The space is airy and clean. The food is quite diverse. There are options for both wet and dry dishes. There is also hot pot. The quality of the food is very okay. The price is only around 40-50 VND for each dish. The owners are gentle and cute. If there is a chance, I will come back. I recommend everyone to experience it."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"Reasonable price, friendly owner and staff. The restaurant is crowded but still tries to serve dishes on time so as not to upset customers."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"Although it was my first time at the restaurant, the owner was very cute and enthusiastic. The food was delicious, diverse, and beautifully decorated. I think this will be a great place for everyone to come and experience vegetarian dishes! Address of the restaurant: 119/3 Hoang Hoa Tham, Ward Thang Tam, Vung Tau City."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"The waiters were indifferent, they had to clean the table 3 or 4 times before they cleared it but it was still very dirty. The restaurant was crowded so I tried to sit and wait patiently but other tables that came in later still got their food first, when I told the staff they were still indifferent. Overall, an extremely bad experience."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"The restaurant space is airy and cozy, the food is super delicious, the price is super reasonable. I will visit the restaurant again next time."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"The vegetarian restaurant is very delicious, with a variety of dishes to choose from. If I have the chance, I will visit again."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"Full 5*! Had such a great breakfast here with noodle soup, tofu and seaweed soup, and Viet fresh spring rolls. The ambiance is fine, but not the focus, so I gave it a 5* as well just because there should not be a distraction from this great food!
Thank you also for the great service, very fast and kind staff!"
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"Located beside a tranquil pond, CHAY TÂM TỪ offers a peaceful and refreshing dining experience for vegetarians and health-conscious travellers.

ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"Quiet atmosphere, simple menu, cheap prices and good food. Only downside is the work being done out the front as it smells. But once inside you can’t smell it."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"A very good and well priced vegan restaurant. One thing that you wanna be aware of before coming in is the smell of the pond/lake right next to this place, which is pretty bad and you can still smell it while eating at this place, so if you are smell sensitive, you probably wanna avoid here. As for the food, I liked the braised mushrooms especially."
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"A great restaurant tucked away just off a main road. The owners used to run a restaurant in HCMC, and it shows in the level of quality, which is clearly a cut above the average in Vung Tau.

We had the fresh springrolls, rice vermicelli soup, lemongrass chili tofu and the delightful lime and mushroom salad, which was probably my favorite.

I recommend anyone, vegetarian, vegan or otherwise to give this place a try!"
ChIJE6sWw-9vdTERGs5U4Edx3lI,"I used Grab delivery several times for veggie food from this place while staying in Vung Tau. Very decent portions, tasty and delicious food. I recommend raw veggie spring rolls 💚 Was pleased to try out mushrooms served along with most of the dishes. Thank you 🙏🏻 Com on 🫶"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"A Vung Tau Institution never a bad meal here always consistent with the food and service. First time back in a couple of years, we had a great lunch and a relaxing time, bumping into old friends!"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Excellent food and service. I come here a lot and always feel very welcome. The menu has a wide selection of food and the portions are large. I usually go for the Belly burger or chicken parmigiana which are both top notch. Great grub no matter what time of the day or night it is and the eatery is usually my go to spot for comfort food! (Especially when hung over)
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Happy Birthday, Belly! What a milestone—57 years of bringing that unbeatable hospitality to the beachfront scene since you were just a wide-eyed 13-year-old back in '68. I can only imagine the stories from those early days: sandy toes, endless waves, and you already gearing up to be the guy who'd hand over his (admittedly threadbare) shirt to a stranger in need. Meeting you in 2006 sounds like the stuff of legend—welcoming folks from every corner of the map, dishing out the absolute best grub under the sun, and turning every gathering into a memory that sticks. Here's to you growing old with that same fire: never dimming, always sharing the laughs, the feasts, and the open-hearted vibe that makes life richer. Cheers to many more beachfront sunsets—may they all come with extra helpings of whatever magic you've got cooking! 🎉🥳"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Nice place for western cuisine, though the servers don't speak much English which made communication a bit complicated.

Hot and fresh food, pizza was freshly oven baked and tasty. The grilled sea bream was well made and the pepper sauce was so good we asked for extra!

Decent vegetarian options too and of course plenty of cold beer 🍺"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Amazing food and drinks, diverse menu, friendly staff and great atmosphere. Would recommend."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"The owner needs to take note. I was in here for lunch and this place was doing the card 4 beers for 100,000 the same as all the other bars. That night it was suddenly 140,000 with staff telling me it has been that way for a while (lies). The menu had the beer for 30,000 and they then tried to charge 35,000. That is false advertising. You are charging way over and trying to scam people. Is the owner who I met today aware this is going on or are the staff cheating people and pocketing the difference? Interested to here back from the owner."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Tasty dishes with huge amount
Spacious and friendly atmosphere
Large parking lot
Friendly staff
Highly rcm"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Good solid expatriate comfort food here. I had the pork with mustard sauce (eh), Giang had the barbecue pork ribs (ah). Giang ordered better than I did. Anyway, they were both good plates of food for a reasonable price. So this looks like the main Australian expatriate hang-out bar of Vung Tao possibly all of Vietnam. Seems like a lot of old timers come together here to pass the time they got left. It also looks like the bar runs tours to Long Tan Cemetery and the battlefields where the Australians fought during the Vietnam / American War. Probably this is the best place where you can learn about Australia's participation and their soldiers' bravery in that war. I don't get it though how some people are defined or find identity by their military service. I'm retired from the American Army.  I don't know, sometimes I feel like I was never in the Army and those decades never happened."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Went here by recommendation.
Ambience was OK
Fries was okay
The fish in fish and chips was terrible.
The steak pie was probably chicken and the consistency more like soup. Microwaved directly from the freezer perhaps?
The full English. Hash browns was okay rest…not so.
Still the worst was the waitress that was disgusting. Keeping on spitting out things from her mouth and putting on any tables ashtray when taking our parser and serving us."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Dropped in on a recommendation from a friend. We walked in the front. Every one starts yelling hello, hey mate 😃. The patrons picked us as Aussies straight away. We were greeted very warmly, served quickly and our Aussie burger and chips were great
Belly (the owner) sat with us for awhile other patrons shouted us drinks. This is an Aussie/ kiwi veteran hangout. We were made to feel right at home
Belly made phone calls to other veterans to organise a tour of the tunnels for us
Definitely a must pop in for a drink type of place especially if you're Aussie or Kiwi"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Very very good restaurant! Food is so tasty and delicious. Many offerings from western dishes to Vietnamese dishes. Prices are fair. Portions are generous. Loved the salmon. Cold refreshing drinks. Good place to hangout and relax while enjoying food. Would recommend. Nice scenery and good background music.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,This is where you can grab some snacks a couple of beers for a lovely evening especially football time. For those who want tasty meals this is absolutely recommended
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Menu was extensive with a lot of good options! The food was delicious & service was quick! Very laid back space, I really enjoyed it! Pictured is the chicken parmesan with fries and rice and bbq pork ribs with fries and rice! The ribs were SO GOOD! Fall off the bone and tender. Would 10/10 recommend."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Offers a range of western and Vietnamese food. Also beer packages. Tasty meal too
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Long established institution here at Vung Tau. The eatery is named after the larger than life character Belly who mingles with the crowds who throngs here.

Hail fellow well met is the ambience here

Belly's Watering Hole was established more than 15 years ago along the Front Beach & moved here to the Aussie enclave about 10 years ago.

Do try the Big Breakfast at VND 150,000 a pop ( circa USD 7.00 ) . Egg Benedict would be another good suggestion. Roast Beef & other savoury fares are served during the weekends"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"We always go for cold,cold beers and great food when visiting Vung Tau. A friendly, mainly expat, clientele just chilling or watching sports on the big TV. The food is really good with generous servings at reasonable prices. The grilled chicken with mushroom parmesan sauce excellent, as was the grilled bass with pepper sauce. A good red wine also reasonable prices."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,I love this place and frequent it often.  I just had the grilled salmon with a white wine sauce and it was absolutely fantastic.  I have to eat gluten free food and their menu has enough selections to allow me to do that.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Great place to visit if you're looking for some expat company. Belly is a great host that supports local community.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"My omelette was very good. A breakfast that really filled me and made me ready for the day.
Enough seats available also for bigger groups.
Service was polite and fast."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"A great place for good food and drink
Buy a bar ticket for100vnd for 5 beers which you can redeem today tomorrow or next week/month"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Definitely OPEN for business as of today: 17-01-2020. Always great food served in substantial portions. Friendly and attractive waitresses. Belly is a very nice guy. Lots of charitable functions here, focusing on the needs of local orphans. Tip jar at the bar when you are leaving. Cheers!"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Great food and drinks and atmosphere here. I think this place is a hidden gem for any travelers looking for something different. Thank You Mr Belly and your staff for the great experience.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Great Service. Excellent food. I had the American Burger. It was by far the biggest burger I've had since being in Vietnam. Nice fresh bun with cheese, lettuce, tomato,  and pickles. I got onions added. The fries were hot and fresh tasty, not greasy."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"6am opening allows for a pirates start on drinking. Friendly ambience, great staff, good service and excellent food, anything from steak pies through to Viet cuisine. Walking distance to many other bars."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Excellent place to go for food and the ice cold beer is cheap!
Staff were super friendly"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Food is good, and nice feel to the place. Staff were a little slow at realising I wanted to add to my order (waited 10 minutes) but were very apologetic and gave me a free coke."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Great place with excellent food and drinks. Lots of Australian customers so always someone to chat with if you speak English. The staff is super friendly.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Super👌. Top quality food and serving size. Staff are great. Nice ambience with Aussie sport.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Food was good Excellent!! I enjoyed it. Staff friendly and good at English spoke. But we couldn't find WiFi there. Just have been there first time maybe can try 1 more some day.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Good food. All the aussie games live. Belly’s a nice guy too. Ripper Aussie bar
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Had Chicken Gordon Blue and Sweet and sour pork
Food was excellent
Huge variety
A definite must visit"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Food is really delicious. I love food here. I don't like decoration much but it's good enough to enjoy a nice meal. I'll go back here soon.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"I love to Come here, good food, nice people,, everything go fast, super place 😊👍"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"What a great bunch of people that run and work here. I found myself eating and drinking here daily.
The atmosphere here was relaxing and friendly with good music a pool table to your left as you walk in.
The place is also supporting under privileged children with Christmas present and food for the village's ❤️❤️❤️"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,I have been here a couple of times and the service is very good and the staff is very friendly. It's a little on the pricy side but definitely worth it once in a while. The food is great. The lamb chops is definitely worth a try.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Food always good in large serving
Has Chicken schnitzel here x3 times while staying in Vung Tau
The establishment supports local schools and orphanages , was a pleasure to support them
Recommend a visit when in Vung Tau"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Great atmosphere. Great food.
Lots of expats"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"It is one of our favourite place in VT now, we had delicious ham and cheese crossiants and they have English books too, we just brought a few back home to read for free, thank you so much."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Ate here a few times. Was always good food and good staff
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Been coming to Bellys for many years and have always felt at home great food and company
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Background music was awful but staff did not change.
Western style food and all western customers if you like that sort of thing… makes me wonder why people travel"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"The staff are incredibly friendly and the food is good. There are many options in the area, but this place seems like the perfect choice. I have been twice, and if time allows, I will return again."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,I have to rave about the coffee here. My go to place in the morning for a coffee now.  My morning latte is always an absolute delight!!
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Really amazing burgers!! First time at Belly’s and wasn’t disappointed ❤️ definitely will be back!
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Food is good.
They have Roast on Sunday and very tasty!"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Recommended by another X pat for tours etc we were not disappointed. Good, beer etc was all above average"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Really nice sunday lunch. Staff are attentive and really nice. Food was delicious.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Great place, good food, cold beer, friendly staffs"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Dropped in to watch All Blacks vs Wallabies test match that kicked off at 0930hrs local time. Friendly owner & staff. Had the Big Breakfast and a couple of beers. Good value and good atmosphere. Good natured banter between the Kiwi and Aussie fans. Would definitely go back.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"We would typically drop by in the evening to have a few beers and chats. The place is not too crowded with some quiet background music(western).
The lamb chops are decent especially when they're drowned in thick gravy that I like!"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Fantastic place for expats, great selection of food, good drinks and the staff are friendly and welcoming.
A must to visit when you gi to Vung Tau."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Nice pub, cold beer and friendly staff. One of the better burgers I've had in Vung Tau."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Being going to Bellys now over the 9 years I have been visiting a great meeting place  food is good value for money and all sports are shown not just the AFL which is plus
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Many choices on menu and all meet expectations. Also good service.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Great place to relax and have a beer. I have had many meals at belly's, and would have to say it's probably best western food in vung tau.  And the Vietnamese dishes are great too. The staff are great , service is spot on! And so many laughs to be had! I always miss this place when I'm not in Vietnam."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Come here every time I visit Vung Tau. Extensive menu with Western dishes and good Vietnamese food too. Plenty of choice for breakfast, lunch and dinner that won't break the bank. Any dish that includes gravy is to die for. Relaxed atmosphere and nice staff. Lots of drinks including cheap beer."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"First impressions of Belly's was that it looked like a fairly basic, no frills place.
However, what wasn't basic was the food, or the service.
Would have to say it was the best meal I had in Vung Tau, steak tender and cooked to perfection, and you just have to try the Apple pie with ice cream!
The staff were jovial and friendly and actually looked like they enjoyed interaction with the customers. Big tick from us"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Loved the atmosphere.  Good cold beer. Great smoothies and staff so friendly. And we could watch rugby league there.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Great value for money at this establishment. Love the All Blacks memorabilia 😄

I had a beer and we enjoyed our meals, even my picky 14yo teenager. This place is low key chill, defo recommend this. ⭐⭐⭐⭐"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Good food great atmosphere expats and vets all feel welcome bar and reataurant veterans
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Quite good dishes. A roomy place. Very friendly and attentive waitresses.
The front part of the place had some British people, watching a football match (rugby) with a pint of beer. Sadly, like the British often do abroad, clad in a singlet and cheap shorts. We preferred to have our dinner in the back part, more ""restaurant"" like."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"The food is fresh, delicious and varied. One of the rare places where you can find pie and gravy, full English, full American breakfast and Vietnamese food. The portions are copious and the ladies are all welcoming, mastering their English skills too. This is the place where you can also rent scooters"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Stopped in for a couple beers and fries.  One waitress was super nice and I joked with her.  Her shift ended at 3pm and she left. The other 4 girls were ice cold. When I tried to use Google translate to get Bill they were dismissive and could not care less about customer service.  I won't come back here.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Where to start... First of all, the 3 waitress ladies are amazing, can not lie about that. The only problem are the expats who are there everyday and think they own the bar. If you're not an Aussie, stay away. Also as a solo female traveller, it's really not a comfortable feeling to be there between only old men who starts being annoying after a bunch of beers. I tried going there 3 times in the hope to meet some younger people, unfortunately, always the same old men. About the food, it's not bad at all but if you want to join your food, 'hide' inside instead of outside where all the drunk expats are."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Found out about this place at the last minute, wish we had found it sooner. Fab choice of food. Belly was very informative on suggestions if where to go in Vietnam. We took his advice and went to Phu Quoc, so glad we did. He arranged for transport to the airport. A must place to visit if you are craving food from home. 👍👍"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Great food and big portions.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"The best place for a meal and a chat with excellent food and staff that are just amazing.... also the owner (belly) is there every day and makes you feel so welcome and special like hes known you for years.... if i could give 10 stars i would, do yourself a favour and drop in for a feed or a beer/beers and experience the best hospitality in vietnam"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Open space with plenty of seating including a pool table and a cool big screen TV for viewing music videos, sports, etc. Service was very attentive (which is a surprise in Vietnam) beer was nice and cold, daily menu specials available and food was above par. Cool place to have some cold brews, western and seafood and to enjoy a chill environment."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"This is the best food in Vietnam and the service is A1. Belly the owner is a legend and well worth having a beer with. Cheers everyone , see you next time 👍🏽"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,After 2 weeks travelling in Vietnam...great to come back to a great Aussie owner and staff
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Love the place. Look for the owner with a tea towel on his shoulder and a bald head with a lawn mower tattoo. A real gentleman.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,I was happy with the burger quality and I will be back; in my opinion the owner should find a solution to reduce the high temperature at noon time and the staff should be more attentive to customers.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"The one and only original. A great place any day and anytime. Breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Thanks, Belly, everyone!"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"The food is good as long as you order there special. The food on the menu is a hot or miss, the service is good , tried the shintzel and lamb and salmon , the salmon was dry , but the rest was nice"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"My wife and I often order food from this restaurant. Always very delicious, and large portions for the price. When getting delivery the staff are always very fast and have plenty of change. When ordering in the restaurant the staff are always very friendly and attentive. Excellent Restaurant!"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"One of few places in Vung Tau with nice reviews, which I decided to visit. Huge menu, with lots of options. Not for 5stars, but best you can get around. Most of visitors are not from here, feeling of the expat bar."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Service was great. As was the food. Beer inexpensive and finally it's an Aussie hangout. What's not to love. Oh, they also rent bikes."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Been here a couple of times now, and the food was so good every time. The staff is really nice!"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Great place to watch Australian sports and international. Food ok service good beer cold and you can buy beer tickets that make the beer even cheaper
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Nice friendly atmosphere and nice western dashes on the menu.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Bellys Restaurant is a fantastic venue for breakfast lunch or dinner, the atmosphere is so friendly and inviting. The choice of food is varied, from western to eastern cultures ( I never had a meal served i was unhappy with ) they also so wifi and foxtell, so you never miss your staying in contact with others or your sports. An added bonus is you can  hire scooters from the bar 😄, and the owner is an avid historian of the area and tour guide"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Went to Belly's late afternoon for a few beers and a feed. Agree with all comments, that atmosphere was great, as was service. My problem is I ordered a pizza, and within a few hours (and all night, and into the next day!) I had violent food poisoning! Not sure if it was the prawns on the pizza, but the end result has not been pretty!!"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"I have been going to Bellys for many years and recomended to many people but has gone down hill food wise.
The Atmosphere is still great service excellent but food is overpriced and not very good. Dishes are short on ingrediants eg. Hamburger good meat but very very little tomato onion and lettuce chips not cooked.. Pizza all cheese very little of anything else.
Sorry Belly just saying what many others are saying also."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Arrived just as they were closing, but the staff looked at my sad starving puppy dog eyes and let me order take away. (Really though I also had my puppy with me and they don’t allow dogs) They were super kind and let me order a piece of pie with ice cream. Just hit the spot. Thank you for rescuing me."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Belly serves his Kiwi mother's recipe for savoury mince on toast with two runny poached eggs on top.
We just spent 4 nights in Vung Tau and we ate it 4 times. Once for brunch. Twice for lunch and once for dinner at night. Comfort food has that sort of magnetic attraction. Lol.
No photos to show as we tucked into it the moment our plates hit the table. Lol."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Very good Vietnamese and international dishes!
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,If it's Sunday lunchtime and you are hungry and missing your favorite sporting match then this is the place for you. Great Sunday lunch box screen sports and cold cold drinks makes it a no excellent watering hole for a summer day in Vung Tau
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Expat bar.  Many long term regulars who keep to themselves , but don't let that put you off.  Good selection in the menu and drink prices are good.
Sport on the TV."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Food is good, especially roast dinners, portions are big, filled up. Good service, separated bills if you are in good and want to. Service is fast. Price is surprisingly cheap."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Been many restruants in Vietnam, Bellys never fails in price, food quality and atmosphere. Definitely worth a visit."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Best lamb roast in many years, even a Yorkshire pudding, definitely get the beer ticket and enjoy a great bar"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Great place to eat n drink also talk to Belly about a Long Tan, Nui Dat tour an experience you'll never forget"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Great western food and very friendly service

Love Belly and the help of Warren to do the long tan tour .
You would be silly not to stop in !"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"As the name suggests you can get a coldie here and a good meal; if you're expat Ozzie you can even get a ""Vegemite sandwhich"" along with a hearty welcome.
And on special occasions you can get entertainment and special meal deals. Belly's is an ideal place for larger group meetings or just a social drop-in to watch sports."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Awesome food ,really nice relaxed people. , if your looking for good steak in vietnam  I would start there.. lamb shanks and spring rolls were beautiful also."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Sat in the bar and ordered Chicken and Chips takeaway and a beer gave up on it 75 mins later when food arrived for a couple sat opposite me who came in 30 mins later than me. Asked for my bill and still tried to charge me for it. What can I say! I understand that he bar was busy because of tet but is that an excuse! I certainly will not come back. Best check my fridge now to see if I can scrape a feed together.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,I had a beer and watched  a rugby league game. Friendly staff and patrons and the owner introduced himself which was nice.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Great place for a beer ,food,and a chat  owner is a champ"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Ideal if you fancy a bit of western cuisine served by friendly staff. Appears to be an expat haunt and most of the expats appear to be Aussie, although I'm ex UK."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Incredible ! Amazing ! We were surprised by really tasty , miamy meals, beautiful food and quality services :) :) . Excellent ! 5 big stars from  traveller's choice ! Unforgettable souvenirs !........ thank you !!!!"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Best breakfast place in Vungtau 👌🏻
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,We were at Belly for breakfast this morning. Our boy plays with toys that belong to Belly around the top of the pool table with light platic car. The table was covered for protection.  A man and remove toys from the table with behavior that is not acceptable to a small boy.  We will not be back to this again.  It is regrettable that someone has such behavior and cannot speak in a more polite manner in font a little boy.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,A great Aussie theme bistro bar .   Excellent food and good value.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Best chicken pho with fresh chilli’s  in Vung Tau
Highly recommend for Breakfast"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,A great expat place great prices I ordered the lamb and it was to die for fall apart
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,I would say the best food you can get in vungtau. Worth the quality and quantity for the price. Definitely a come back place.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"I have eaten here a few times, it's also good if you just want a beer. It's always good."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Atrocious service with a very arrogant attitude from waiters and some discriminatory argument and treatment when not Australian or English-Speaking Natives. Should better train their waiters. Non-Australian, please avoid."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Good food and service was great. A great neighborhood bar
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Yummy Steakpie with mashed potatoes, gravy and peas. Cold beer, fresh coconut . Great place for some western food."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"We had dinner the last night we were in Vung Tau, wish we would have found it sooner. Really good food at a decent price."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Nice food, nice staff"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Higly recommend. Good food, very much to choose. Just little bit expensive"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"4 of us had dinner there & it was great, 2x Lamb Shanks, 1 Lamb rack & 1 pie."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Great big plates of food at very cheap price. Lovely service.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Breakfast this morning. Seafood fried rice and fresh coconut juice. Always an enjoyable meal. No fancy stuff just good taste tucker. Good staff.
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"I should have trusted my nose. The lemon butter sauce on the fish smelled off but I ate it anyway, maybe rancid butter. Now I have a bad belly. Thanks Belly's for ruining my holiday!"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Consistently good food! One of my favourite spots to go for seabass for lunch! You can get a dandy roast on Sundays as well!
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"A Vung Tau Institution never a bad meal here always consistent with the food and service. First time back in a couple of years, we had a great lunch and a relaxing time, bumping into old friends!"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,Excellent food and service. I come here a lot and always feel very welcome. The menu has a wide selection of food and the portions are large. I usually go for the Belly burger or chicken parmigiana which are both top notch. Great grub no matter what time of the day or night it is and the eatery is usually my go to spot for comfort food! (Especially when hung over)
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Happy Birthday, Belly! What a milestone—57 years of bringing that unbeatable hospitality to the beachfront scene since you were just a wide-eyed 13-year-old back in '68. I can only imagine the stories from those early days: sandy toes, endless waves, and you already gearing up to be the guy who'd hand over his (admittedly threadbare) shirt to a stranger in need. Meeting you in 2006 sounds like the stuff of legend—welcoming folks from every corner of the map, dishing out the absolute best grub under the sun, and turning every gathering into a memory that sticks. Here's to you growing old with that same fire: never dimming, always sharing the laughs, the feasts, and the open-hearted vibe that makes life richer. Cheers to many more beachfront sunsets—may they all come with extra helpings of whatever magic you've got cooking! 🎉🥳"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Nice place for western cuisine, though the servers don't speak much English which made communication a bit complicated.

Hot and fresh food, pizza was freshly oven baked and tasty. The grilled sea bream was well made and the pepper sauce was so good we asked for extra!

Decent vegetarian options too and of course plenty of cold beer 🍺"
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Amazing food and drinks, diverse menu, friendly staff and great atmosphere. Would recommend."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"The owner needs to take note. I was in here for lunch and this place was doing the card 4 beers for 100,000 the same as all the other bars. That night it was suddenly 140,000 with staff telling me it has been that way for a while (lies). The menu had the beer for 30,000 and they then tried to charge 35,000. That is false advertising. You are charging way over and trying to scam people. Is the owner who I met today aware this is going on or are the staff cheating people and pocketing the difference? Interested to here back from the owner."
ChIJDesoe8dvdTERNliNVrNDRxY,"Tasty dishes with huge amount
Spacious and friendly atmosphere
Large parking lot
Friendly staff
Highly rcm"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Order was clear but when my plate is served. Presentation is great! The size of my beef steak is not up to 200g. Felt cheated and I ask for medium well, almost half of it was black and dry, over grilled! taste very blend. I do enjoy the salad cuz is fresh! I dont see any special about the skills of the chefs here! Price is reasonable! Maybe I will order something like sashimi next time cuz it just have to be fresh and no skills needed!"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"The food here is absolutely delicious! Every dish we tried was bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend the crab spaghetti . The presentation was beautiful, too – each plate looked like a work of art."""
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Amazing food and service! The meat is perfectly cooked and the sushi is also amazing.

Price is also good for the portions you receive. Definitely a must go if you visit Vung Tau!"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"BEST SUSHI IN VUNG TAU Amazing food and presentation. Exceptional service. Everything was cooked well.    egg salad,  eel roll, rib eye salmon roll/ beef roll  my face says it all."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,The place had a great atmosphere and was very clean. The staff were incredibly friendly. The steak was perfectly cooked—tender and full of flavor. The salad was fresh and crisp.
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"unbelievable that in Vung Tau has this amazing restaurant. Their steaks are perfecly cooked, the sauces, potatoes and salads are fresh and well seasoning. My son loves the spagetti here.

Plus point for this restaurant: They are kids friendly, they have high chair, dining set for kids and a scissor to chop food for kids.

The atmosphere are quiet and the music so relax.
Perfect for couples and family with children and elderly."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Come back here every time I visit Vung Tau, but this time with family. Glad to see the business is booming while still maintaining its quality. Can’t wait to come back for more!"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"A very clean and pleasant spot. The food was exceptional, especially for the price. We’ve just found our new favorite place to eat!"""
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Excellent atmosphere with great choices of beer!
Also very attentive staffs."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Food was good, service was attentive.
Vibe is like an industrial place in a good way.
You get a free dish if you review them, which isn’t necessary as they would deserve a good review anyway."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,Best steak I have gotten here. After all the Vietnamese food (especially seafood) we were craving this. The ribeye steak was cooked medium rare and the corn and scallops were an good addition. Would recommend and come back
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"So delicious! Great price and perfectly cooked steak, everyone should experience Black Pan 🤩"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"This restaurant has sushi, pasta, and steak, and I only tried their steak. I wanted to have ribeyes, but it was sold out, so I had top blade and hokubee. I like their top blade over hokubee even though hokubee is priced much higher. The beef bowls I had were also decent and the top blade beef bowl was pretty good especially."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Great steak restaurant. My wife and I often go for special occasions. It’s not cheap but it also a good value for the money. Lots of good food. My wife, who is Việt, especially loves the steak. But really everything is prepared well. The service is also very good. But the place is small so go early or go late."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Nice food and amazing atmosphere. We tried Ribeye, Salmon and Unagi rice. The stir-fried corn with scallops is a good option to have with beer. Their staffs are friendly and helpful. Must try 🤓"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"I was feeling homesick so I came here for comfort food and omg… best steak and sushi in Vung Tau! Super yummy, me and mum loved it!"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,The food was absolutely delicious and the service was great. The order came out super fast. All exactly as shown.
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"This is not a steak , it  is meat with some injections to make it so tender that you don't need a knife. You will feel that the texture is not meat anymore. Not a place for meat. They have the Japanese option which seems the popular choice. We ordered Hokubee and Ribeye hoping for a tasty dinner."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Cozy atmosphere and delicious foods, this restaurant offers a variety of choices for dining. The steaks are perfectly cooked to your preference, and the side dishes are also delicious. The staff is friendly, I would recommend this restaurant and will definitely return for more."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Great food
Steaks are tasety.
Beef rice / spagetthi also good.

Best with variety of imported beers  and some wines."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"My wife and I spent the day traveling from hanoi, flew into hcmc and got a private car to vung tau.

Looked around on maps for a restaurant, this one made the short list.  So glad we came here first!  Probably will come back.
Best squid weve had in our month here in vietnam.  Steak was perfect, melted in your mouth.  Sushi was excellent.  Reasonable prices.

Tan Phuc was our server, he was fantastic!  Even spoke english.  6/5 stars, will probably be back before we leave vung tau (are here for a little less than a week."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,Enjoyed an array of food beautifully presented. Salmon was cooked perfectly. Rib eye steak was brilliant. Spag bol was amazing . Highly recommend
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,Great steakhouse. I think it would be better if its open space as it is quite loud on the day we eat. Delicious steak with great price
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"I visited Black Pan Steak in Vũng Tàu, Vietnam, after a long day of exploring, and it was one of the best dining experiences I’ve had in my three years of traveling across Asia. I was starving, so I ordered two meals: sushi and the Hokubee steak. The sushi was fresh and delicious, but the Hokubee steak stole the show—it was, hands down, the best steak I’ve ever had.

It’s rare (no pun intended) to find a restaurant that gets a rare steak cooked perfectly, but Black Pan Steak nailed it. Most places overcook or underseason it, leaving me disappointed and wishing I’d grilled it myself. Not here—the steak was absolutely flawless, so much so that I came back the very next day and ordered two portions.

The staff were incredibly friendly, attentive, and made me feel right at home. Their hospitality was top-notch, which added to the overall amazing experience.

If you’re in Vũng Tàu, you have to stop at Black Pan Steak. The food, service, and atmosphere are truly exceptional. I’m already planning to return a few more times before heading to my next destination. 10/10 recommend!"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"We spent 7 days in Vung Tau and this was the best restaurant we found on the journey. Food was served fast and was excellent. We had tuna, egg salad, beef, french fries and duck. Helpful staff spoke english and they were helpful (unlike many other restaurants here). Have to visit here again sometime! ++"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Real nice. Cozy and stuff, theres also some kind of music show somewhere at 20:00 I believe. The ribeye was good, and I particularly liked the way they made the pepper sauce. Quite luxurious, but for the service then its kinda fine. Also no photo."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Black Pan Steak House in Vung Tau offers a delightful dining experience with tender, flavorful steaks cooked to perfection.

We enjoy our lunch with my husband.

The cozy atmosphere and attentive service complement the delicious dishes. A must-visit for steak lovers!"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,It's really good! Served really quick too
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"If u travel at Vung Tau ,don't forget to try this restaurant, so good"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Ordered the Combo Ribeye steak with a side of crab stick and avocado salad.
Salad was fresh and crunchy with nice dressing.
Steak was good, though nothing spectacular. I ordered the green pepper sauce which was also good, but not thoroughly heated. Chips were fresh but lacked some salt (which may be a matter of taste).
Overall pleasant experience."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"What a epic experience, never heard about Hokube beef but they had in must try list and thar was value for money, all plate including mash potato, aspargus, mushroom creamy sauce and especially interesting niche marinated pepper. Fantastic combo. Place has Japan style interior which gives nice vibe for traditional Vietnamese interior change."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,It was nice foods. Nice atmosphere. Nice servers. Everything was perfect
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Clean, chill place, food is fantastic, enjoyed beers and steaks so much!"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Ribeye steak is so tender! It feels like it just melted in your mouth!
Last time tried the combo plate and that was amazing too! 😻"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,The food is delicious. Service is very fast. Staff is very friendly and attentive. Portions are relatively small (Asian-sized).
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"A delicious meal! Perfectly seared steak, crispy fries, fresh salad, and a creamy dip, topped off with a refreshing tropical drink. However, a 200-gram steak is a bit too much for one person."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"The steak was very well prepared, tender and juicy.  The salad was excellent.  The service was top notch! We will definitely be back!!!"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"I’ve ate here a few times in the past month. It’s been delicious every time. The best place for steak in Vietnam in my opinion. Better than B3 steakhouse in Saigon.
They always open the door for me here at Black Pan and grill the steak the way I want.

Their motto says it all: No steak no life

I just wish they sold shirts or souvenirs. :)

Update: the manager provided me a very nice keychain souvenir"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Really good experience here , we tried the Rib Eye , it was melting In your mouth.
Next day we tried the cheapest meat they had, with spaghetti and cream sauce it was amazing too , good flavors ! The chef here definitely knows what he/she is doing!
They also make amazing sushi , they’re sashimi with ponzu sauce was amazing.
And the food here is actually really cheap compared to the high quality food you get here. Plus the staff here is very kind , good at English and try to do their best to make you feel comfortable with you visit here."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"We keep coming back to this restaurant... the food is great, the service is terrific, and the atmosphere is very nice."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,After a long vacation is time for some good food again.
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"The food is very good.I recommend the pasta. You must try it!
The staff are lovely."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,Price performance ratio optimal. Staff super friendly and work quickly. We were happy with everything and can recommend it if you want to eat a decent piece of meat. Personal requests were accepted without any problems and a separate set was provided for the child.
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,Good Restaurant with reasonable price and good food.
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Great place for family and friends! It's really affordable and tasty.

Would recommend"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"A clean and cosy restaurant. The food is great, there are 2 types of food: sushi and meat. Meat can be served with 4 different sorts of sauce and can be cooked with different kinds of readiness. The price is ok also. But the portions are a bit too small."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,great steak with nice staffs. Feeling blissed!
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,The food is so tasty and such good value! The service is amazing; the staff can not do enough for you. We're only in Vung tau for 2 nights but we'll be back tomorrow!
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,Lovely restaurant with amazing food. Food was tasty and served very efficiently. Staff were all very polite and well mannered. Would 100% recommend to anyone nearby
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Nice vibe, food is amazing..
Customer service is perfect"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"The quality of the beef or fish is outstanding except the French fries. If they would create it by them self it would be more tasty.

I ate here a rib eye steak which was perfectly grilled and the meat was amazing tender. I ordered as an extra a green paper sauce but I don’t used it for the beef cause that would ruin the quality of the beef.

The pepper sauce was good to dip the French fries inside and definitely create good.

Me personally would wish that a chimichurri were available for the steak but I can understand that is not there concept.

Service excellent and Ambiente had a touch of American steak house.

I can definitely recommend"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,The Food was delicious. The ribeye was melt in your mouth... I've never had ribeye so tender! The menu says the meat platter is for 3 to 4 people and it defintely is only for two people. Would be far too little food for 3 or 4. The french fries are great. We had to order more.
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Very good food , good service , smiling waters,  the price very good 👍,  I will be back for sure"

ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Hokobe beef was nice and tender, top blade was quite tough, and rib eye was in between. Cooked to your liking. Sauces were nice and it’s very affordably priced for 3 steaks. Good imported beers. They gave a promotional soft drink or salad with our meal for lunch which was nice. Though they forced me to leave this review before leaving, which kind of inconvenienced us, I would still come back."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Food is delicious!
Must try Lobster."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,Best view and tasty beers 😋

ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"A nice place to eat. Great steakes, kind staff members and a good atmosphere:)"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,Thank you! Perfect food♥️♥️♥️
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"They have a high google rating due to their bribery policy of free food with each review and photo posted :(
I would have given 4 stars, but I was bit annoyed that they are using bribery in order to get reviews. You receive a free menu item or drink for every posted review. And of course people are never going to post anything negative when you are getting something for free.

The staff were all amazing. The food was pretty decent - although my steak was so so. I would rate this place a solid 4 out of 5 but believe reviews should be unbiased and not exaggerated from the offer of free food - which is why I have downgraded my score."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,So yummy :)
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,Delicious food ❤️
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"The best steak in Vungtau, cozy atmosphere, the price is reasonable."

ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,Very good place with a perfect steaks. Recommended.
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Tasty food, my wife and I got the meat platter, quality was okay, advertising it's for 3-4 people is questionable, but just about acceptable for a couple. Even that's questionable🥴"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Good food, fast delivery"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Best steak I've had in Vietnam. Large menu means everyone can be happy. I had a bit of salmon sushi as an appetizer, it was up to par."

ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,Amazing food and great service!
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Good beer with a steak cant go wrong with those combination, beer is cold and nice but for the steak could do better.

Considering the price for the beer and steak, will come back again, good price but if you look for juicy steak this is not your place.

Should expand the steak choice"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Very good restaurant. Staff are friendly and speak English. Small menu, but done very well. Prices are cheap and service is super fast. Icy cold draft beer. Very clean restaurant. Also has kids play area."

ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,Good meal
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,Tried to fool me by saying the CB machine wasn’t working. Which did ofc. They all try to fool foreigners in Vung Tau anyway. Don’t come here.
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,Great 👍
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Very friendly service. Clean place.

Steak was of good quality but served rather cold. I would visit again but ask to ensure meat was served hot."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,The salmon spaghetti was SO GOOD! You need to eat here.
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,Great place! Amazing food! Friendly and helpful staff! Great service! I recommend it to everyone!!!

ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,very tasty!!!
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Just great place. Food, people, vibe. Nice, nice, nice👍🙂 Recommend with two hands 🙂"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Order was clear but when my plate is served. Presentation is great! The size of my beef steak is not up to 200g. Felt cheated and I ask for medium well, almost half of it was black and dry, over grilled! taste very blend. I do enjoy the salad cuz is fresh! I dont see any special about the skills of the chefs here! Price is reasonable! Maybe I will order something like sashimi next time cuz it just have to be fresh and no skills needed!"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"The food here is absolutely delicious! Every dish we tried was bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend the crab spaghetti . The presentation was beautiful, too – each plate looked like a work of art."""
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Amazing food and service! The meat is perfectly cooked and the sushi is also amazing.

Price is also good for the portions you receive. Definitely a must go if you visit Vung Tau!"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"BEST SUSHI IN VUNG TAU Amazing food and presentation. Exceptional service. Everything was cooked well.    egg salad,  eel roll, rib eye salmon roll/ beef roll  my face says it all."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,The place had a great atmosphere and was very clean. The staff were incredibly friendly. The steak was perfectly cooked—tender and full of flavor. The salad was fresh and crisp.
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"unbelievable that in Vung Tau has this amazing restaurant. Their steaks are perfecly cooked, the sauces, potatoes and salads are fresh and well seasoning. My son loves the spagetti here.

Plus point for this restaurant: They are kids friendly, they have high chair, dining set for kids and a scissor to chop food for kids.

The atmosphere are quiet and the music so relax.
Perfect for couples and family with children and elderly."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Come back here every time I visit Vung Tau, but this time with family. Glad to see the business is booming while still maintaining its quality. Can’t wait to come back for more!"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"A very clean and pleasant spot. The food was exceptional, especially for the price. We’ve just found our new favorite place to eat!"""
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Excellent atmosphere with great choices of beer!
Also very attentive staffs."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Food was good, service was attentive.
Vibe is like an industrial place in a good way.
You get a free dish if you review them, which isn’t necessary as they would deserve a good review anyway."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,Best steak I have gotten here. After all the Vietnamese food (especially seafood) we were craving this. The ribeye steak was cooked medium rare and the corn and scallops were an good addition. Would recommend and come back
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"So delicious! Great price and perfectly cooked steak, everyone should experience Black Pan 🤩"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"This restaurant has sushi, pasta, and steak, and I only tried their steak. I wanted to have ribeyes, but it was sold out, so I had top blade and hokubee. I like their top blade over hokubee even though hokubee is priced much higher. The beef bowls I had were also decent and the top blade beef bowl was pretty good especially."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Great steak restaurant. My wife and I often go for special occasions. It’s not cheap but it also a good value for the money. Lots of good food. My wife, who is Việt, especially loves the steak. But really everything is prepared well. The service is also very good. But the place is small so go early or go late."
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"Nice food and amazing atmosphere. We tried Ribeye, Salmon and Unagi rice. The stir-fried corn with scallops is a good option to have with beer. Their staffs are friendly and helpful. Must try 🤓"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"I was feeling homesick so I came here for comfort food and omg… best steak and sushi in Vung Tau! Super yummy, me and mum loved it!"
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,The food was absolutely delicious and the service was great. The order came out super fast. All exactly as shown.
ChIJP9mwZL5vdTERtjrdNJQXNB0,"This is not a steak , it  is meat with some injections to make it so tender that you don't need a knife. You will feel that the texture is not meat anymore. Not a place for meat. They have the Japanese option which seems the popular choice. We ordered Hokubee and Ribeye hoping for a tasty dinner."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Very goid food and service. 9 off us. Victor was so accommadating and helpful and friendly. Pizza is awesome. Egg and bacon rolls delish.
Thank you Victor and staff"
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"This was our first visit to the Offshore and we came specificaly for the Sunday Roast. The decor is clean and simple with great seating, with outdoor and indoor seating to choose from. The menu has all the Western dishes one could crave for, from breakfast, lunch and dinner entrees. The Sunday Roast was hands down as good as Moms home cooking on a Sunday dinner. The pork roast was moist and served up with a generous portion of potato, roast root vegetables, roasted pumpkin, cauliflower, brocolli and peas, along with a very flavourfull gravy. I can understand how they sell out early, so its best to reserve or come early. Being only 300 meters from the Melody on a quite residental street it has ease of access. I would highly recomend eating here, for great food, personable friendly owners and a relaxing atmosphere. Great job gentlemen! See you again real soon, this time with our two daughters to sample more on the menu!"
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,Professional service style of the restaurant owner.
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"The neighborhood is quiet, the owner is cheerful and kind, he can speak English, and the food is good value for money. I plan to visit again next time I come to Vung Tau."

I give it ☆☆☆☆☆ on every aspect. My friend told me about it & I'm very thankful to him."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"This restaurant must go viral, guys. It's a coincidence that the restaurant is opposite the hotel. I went in to eat and unexpectedly the taste was so good. The portion is big so you should order 2 dishes if you go with 2 people. 10 points for pizza."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,Good and big portions....
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Very good food, great service and friendly staff. Nice relaxed atmosphere 👍👍"

ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Hoi, the chef and Victor run a clean cool restaurant with a great menu and the prices the cheapest i have come across in Vung Tau.

ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Wow,  if I could give 6 stars I would.
Came for brunch, we ordered the big breakfast and omelette. Owner came out with a toastie first by mistake and gave it to us on the house. Might be the best toastie I've had and the big breakfast was definitely the best I've had in SE Asia .
Anita said omelette was great!
Coffee is limited but have plenty of fresh smoothies and juices to make up for it!

This place is amazing and we would most definitely come back.

ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,Really lovely place. Good foreign food. (predominantly Aussie style.) Great customer service. Felt very welcomed by Victor. Best Schnitzel I’ve had in Vung Tau.
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"This is a great place for mainly Western style food cooked in the kitchen by two young blokes (one is the owner). Roast dinners are usually available every night and they are not small servings. However having tried a lot of the menu I have yet to find anything that wasn't good and as I said quite ample in size. Beer and soft drinks are available. Prices are incredibly good (160,000 VND for the roast), parking is on the street, friendly and welcoming staff and the food is great."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,Very good service and delicious food
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Delicious food, fresh shrimp in soup, lots of food and reasonable price. Lovely staff, will come back when coming to VT"

The prices are very reasonable, and the food is delicious.

Wiktoria had a pizza and she really enjoyed it — perfectly cooked and tasty.
I ordered the Big Breakfast, their version of the English breakfast, and it was excellent – fresh, well-prepared, and very satisfying.

Overall, a great experience and definitely worth a visit. Highly recommended! 🌞🍽️"

ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"The restaurant is very delicious. If you like European food, you should try it. The portion is quite large, you should consider ordering dishes that suit your stomach. My mother and I ordered 2 portions, we were so full 😊😊😊"
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Victor was super friendly and welcoming. My partner had the big breakfast and I had the toastie. It was delicious. Honestly a lot better than most places in Melbourne, Australia. Would recommend!!"

ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"I came here on a rainy Sunday afternoon, slightly damp from the rain for some very tasty homestyle food. It being Sunday, I chose the Sunday Roast.   They offer a Sunday roast with either Beef, Lamb or Pork.  I was lucky to get the last portion of roast lamb.  It was a large plate with great meat and gravy with some roasted vegetables, potatoes, sweet potato, onion, carrot, broccoli, cauliflower and some peas.

The location of the restaurant is not far off the main PCT road, perhaps 200m down Phan Huy Ich.

If I lived in VungTau, I'd eat this every Sunday.

Reasonable prices, good food and environment.  Enthusiastic staff."

I went last night, because i was looking for some good western/European food, and this was the best choice i have ever made, it all looked so good, so we took the chicken parmigiana (which for me was one of the best ive actually ate in my life), one Mexican pizza and one Hawaiian pizza.(i recommend trying as well the peper sauce and the tartar as an extra!! Both delicious)
This is the second time i come to Vietnam, and this is by far the best western/European food that i have tried here.
The taste was phenomenal for both pizza and the chicken, the food is really fresh, the portions are generous and the service is just amazing, even though i ordered to go, the service was very very good from Victor!!
Sadly i found this restaurant on my last day in Vung Tau, but im 100% sure that whenever i come back, this place will be my 1st stop!!"

It was a large plate with great meat and gravy with some roasted vegetables, potatoes, sweet potato, onion, carrot, broccoli, cauliflower and some peas.

The location of the restaurant is not far off the main PCT road, perhaps 200m down Phan Huy Ich.

If I lived in VungTau, I'd eat this every Sunday.

Reasonable prices, good food and environment.  Enthusiastic staff."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Had a very good experience in this establishment. I had a schnitzel with peppercorn sauce. It was very delicious. Others in our party had pepperoni pizza and Phoʻ - everyone commented on how good the food was, plus generous helpings.
The owner was very friendly and spoke excellent English and was very attentive.

Would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a bit more variety than seafood or standard vietnamese fare."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"The food is delicious, the staff is so nice 🥰
Great place! Tasty dishes and super nice service ❤️"
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Along a small street lined with cute hotels, far from the hustle and bustle of the beachfront, this little restaurant serves up an amazing breakfast for two, costing less than €4. The waiter speaks both English and French, a truly simple moment of bliss. Don't hesitate to go there."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Cold beers? Check!
Delicious food? Check!
Good service? Check!

Thanks for the delicious pizza and cold beer. Your service was also impeccable, and felt very personal, yet professional.

I’ll definitely be back another time. A quiet and relaxing place to take a break and charge up."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"The food here is really delicious, very European style, especially the très délicieux pizza, not available everywhere... The owner is very cute and thoughtful. Thank you bro!"
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Awesome burgers! love the homemade buns, not sweet and no margarine aroma like a typical Vietnam bun.
Homemade pizza dough upon order, not pre-made and frozen like many here.
Their Sunday Roasts sells out quickly over lunch. got to come early.
And I couldn't believe their affordable prices!
All good stuff!"
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Good food, had chicken Parmigiana! Recommended!"
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,This is a restaurant truly worth visiting. One of the few authentic Australian Aussie burgers.
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"The first time I ate European food that was both cheap and of such good quality, the service was so cute. I can't believe there's such a cheap restaurant right in the city center. I just realized the phrase ""delicious, nutritious, and cheap"". It's amazing 😍😍
Everyone should try it."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"The restaurant is opposite the hotel so I came to try it. The portion is big and the taste is delicious, easy to eat for Vietnamese people. The price is reasonable. I will come back if I have a chance to go to Vung Tau."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"The food here is really delicious, very European style, especially the très délicieux pizza, not available everywhere... The owner is very cute and thoughtful. Thank you bro!"
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Good food, had chicken Parmigiana! Recommended!"
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"The pancakes were terrible, clearly from a box. The maple syrup tasted like honey, horrible."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"This is a great place for mainly Western style food cooked in the kitchen by two young blokes (one is the owner). Roast dinners are usually available every night and they are not small servings. However having tried a lot of the menu I have yet to find anything that wasn't good and as I said quite ample in size. Beer and soft drinks are available. Prices are incredibly good (160,000 VND for the roast), parking is on the street, friendly and welcoming staff and the food is great."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Tasty food, great portion, friendly owner, breezy ambient, best place to stop by for some delicious pizzas and burgers."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Been a couple of times as a new resident in Vung Tau and going again. Had a beetroot soup, seafood pizza and roast beef dinner on my two visits. The beetroot soup was prepared beautifully, just a different sweeter style. The pizza was first rate, both toppings and base while the beef was amazing quality with a good choice of tasty vegetables. Friendly place where I will go often."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"I had delicious spaghetti with ham last night, and I'd definitely go back.
Friendly owner (Victor)"
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,Great food everything I have eaten there has been excellent..Sunday roasts..pizzas..rissoles are really good..service is excellent aswell keep up the good work guys
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Delicious food, beautiful, cute owner. Everyone is welcome to come and enjoy 🤌🏻🩷"
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,Really lovely place. Good foreign food. (predominantly Aussie style.) Great customer service. Felt very welcomed by Victor. Best Schnitzel I’ve had in Vung Tau.
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Best western food in Vietnam, really friendly and amazing owner as well!"
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Stopped in for lunch. The new location is great 👍 quiet, breezy and chic. The double cheeseburger 🍔 was GREAT! I also had the garlic toast which was very good. Grabbed a potato salad to go. Ask for Victor, he's very nice and speaks English! 👍 I'll def be returning."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,Awesome! Now my favorite place in Vung Tau 🥰
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Tried the offshore special pizza, good ingredients. Definitely will keep coming back."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,slim
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"The food was surprisingly delicious.
Don't be fooled by the restaurant's atmosphere.
The restaurant is small and lacks air conditioning, but the food and prices are truly excellent."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"This place is just incredible!!

I went last night, because i was looking for some good western/European food, and this was the best choice i have ever made, it all looked so good, so we took the chicken parmigiana (which for me was one of the best ive actually ate in my life), one Mexican pizza and one Hawaiian pizza.(i recommend trying as well the peper sauce and the tartar as an extra!! Both delicious)
This is the second time i come to Vietnam, and this is by far the best western/European food that i have tried here.
The taste was phenomenal for both pizza and the chicken, the food is really fresh, the portions are generous and the service is just amazing, even though i ordered to go, the service was very very good from Victor!!
Sadly i found this restaurant on my last day in Vung Tau, but im 100% sure that whenever i come back, this place will be my 1st stop!!"
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,10/10!! 😍 - They have everything you could want want
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,Had a lovely burger and chips topped off with some HP brown sauce.
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"The food here is absolutely amazing! I’ve tried many restaurants in Vung Tau, but nothing comes close to this one. The owner is incredibly polite and truly understands what good taste means. Every dish is cooked with care and packed with authentic flavors.

If you’re visiting from India, this place is a must-try — you’ll feel right at home with the taste. It’s definitely worth coming here; I can guarantee you won’t regret it!"
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,Always delicious food and large portions
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"A diner worth recommending. A new place, clean with a nice view and reasonable prices. Open every day from 8 AM. The owner Victor is a Malaysian sweetheart, that carries a hint of Singaporean culture that enriches the experience."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,Great food and big servings for a reasonable price.

The waiter speaks both English and French, a truly simple moment of bliss. Don't hesitate to go there."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"This was our first visit to the Offshore and we came specificaly for the Sunday Roast. The decor is clean and simple with great seating, with outdoor and indoor seating to choose from. The menu has all the Western dishes one could crave for, from breakfast, lunch and dinner entrees. The Sunday Roast was hands down as good as Moms home cooking on a Sunday dinner. The pork roast was moist and served up with a generous portion of potato, roast root vegetables, roasted pumpkin, cauliflower, brocolli and peas, along with a very flavourfull gravy. I can understand how they sell out early, so its best to reserve or come early. Being only 300 meters from the Melody on a quite residental street it has ease of access. I would highly recomend eating here, for great food, personable friendly owners and a relaxing atmosphere. Great job gentlemen! See you again real soon, this time with our two daughters to sample more on the menu!"
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,Had a wonderful steak. Nicely done and taste good
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,Excellent service and food
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"The food is delicious
Very suitable for those who like European food
The owner gives clear advice, you should try before ordering many dishes when going alone, because 1 portion will be a lot, thank you
Will come back if I have the opportunity to go to Vung Tau"
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Great Food
Good Portions
Good People
I highly recommend this restaurant.
👍"
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"I recently had the pleasure of dining here, and everything from the atmosphere to the service was top-notch. But what truly stood out was the pumpkin soup – hands down one of the best I've ever tasted.

Creamy, rich, and perfectly seasoned, it had a beautiful balance of sweetness and savory depth. The texture was silky smooth, with just a hint of nutmeg and perhaps a touch of ginger that gave it a comforting warmth. Served hot with a side of crusty bread, it was the perfect starter – or honestly, a satisfying meal on its own.

You can tell it’s made from scratch with quality ingredients. If you’re visiting, do yourself a favor and order the pumpkin soup. It’s a standout dish that turns a simple classic into something truly memorable.

Highly recommended – I’ll definitely be coming back for more!"

ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"A hidden restaurant that I accidentally found out because I stayed at the hotel across the street

The food is super delicious, especially the portion is so big, 2 dishes can fill 2 people up, pizza, fried chicken salad is extremely delicious, must try everyone"
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,Delicious food with a varied menu.
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,The roast dinners are particularly good.  I come here regularly and the food and service is always good.
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"It's really delicious. The price is also cheaper. If you have time, be sure to visit and try it. It is actively recommended."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"My wife and I come to eat often. We both enjoy the food here. We both recommend the quality of the food.
Get there early on Sunday for the tasty roast dinner...it is sometimes sold out early."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Not only was the food delicious, but the owner (Victor) was also very friendly. This place is a must-visit in Vung Tau!"

ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,Best home made chips!! Solid roast too!
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,Great place. Very tasty. Large portions. The staff is polite and speaks English. Comfortable chairs. Large selection of food. Breakfast is available.
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,Very delicious food. Very reasonable price. The owners are very nice.
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Great restaurant, hidden away in side streets... it's awesome food and great price...!
I give it ☆☆☆☆☆ on every aspect. My friend told me about it & I'm very thankful to him."
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,First time coming here. Food and ambiance is good.
ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Been a couple of times as a new resident in Vung Tau and going again. Had a beetroot soup, seafood pizza and roast beef dinner on my two visits.

ChIJ3UphDQBvdTERsTcRYyrejBc,"Hands down our favorite spot in vung tau. The staff are absolutely awesome, super friendly and accommodating. Delicious food at very reasonable prices. The new location is breezy and beautiful. All round good vibes  💯% recommend 👌"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Inside, we really love the interior decorations that was casual, bright and lively. There’s a huge lobster cartoon painted on the main wall of the restaurant and if you look really carefully, you’ll find a few “Nemo’s” (clown fish) on the mural as well. The staff were also really friendly, making recommendations for the dishes. Thanks to the recommendation, we tried something that we’ve not really tasted before but really enjoyed. Upon being seated, we were given the menu and in our minds, we had an idea of what we wanted to have. From the reviews, we saw that the grilled prawns were ordered quite frequently and we ordered a dish of 7 prawns. The staff did share that these were frozen and not live prawns but we were quite happy with our selection thereafter.

We also knew that we wanted to have some crabs as we don’t normally have them in Singapore. Unlike what we saw from the menus online, Quach’s have actually improved their menu by including the /kg prices of the live crabs, lobsters and prawns. This is unlike what it did previously with “market prices”. With this, the prices would probably be a little higher but for customers, you know that there would be no haggling of prices here.

Moreover, to add to the transparency, we were asked which type of mud crabs we wanted (female with roe are slightly more expensive) and they were picked and weighed out on the scale in our presence. The bucket was “zeroed” first so that the scale with the bucket was at “0kg”, allowing the weight of the crabs to be displayed when placed within the bucket. We also asked if we could have two different crabs with two different styles of preparations – to which the staff readily agreed. Later, we found that there was no additional charges for this arrangement as well...

For more details on what we had at Quach's Seafood Restaurant Vung Tau, visit 2bearbear today!"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Had one of the best dining experiences in Vietnam. Flavors were on point and delicious, staff were all so warm and attentive, the place had such a warm, homey and comfortable vibe. Prices were also very reasonable. Will definitely go back here when I get to visit Vung Tau again. Aside from the fresh and tasty seafood, I think what really impressed me is the hospitality that the staff showed. I hope you can keep providing travellers with hearty seafood meals and amazing service for many many more years to come. I highly recommend this awesome restaurant!"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,Staff is very accommodating and friendly. They welcome us with a smile. Must try is the deep fried baby squid. My personal favorite is egg fried rice.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Great food, well prepared, attention to details. Very well-trained and responsive staff. Most of the food I ordered was good, except the stingray hotpot. It was mediocre."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"I had high expectation from this restaurant. It’s one of the highest rated seafood restaurants in Vung Tau even though it costs close to double of its competitors (Oc Thu Nhien). This is why I decided to go there to have a seafood dinner.

Unfortunately for me, I left disappointed. I should have known when the restaurant was empty during dinner time on a Saturday night. Though the service staff are attentive, helpful and can speak English, I am penalising the restaurant because of the food. Let’s break down what I ordered one by one:

Crab meat fried rice
- There was barely any crab meat in there. A few shredded pieces.
- The fried rice was very dry.

Garlic butter small lobster
- The seasoning was great.
- Portion size for 2-3 people.
- Toughest small lobster I have ever had in my life. Just to cut the flesh, I thought I was going to break my metal fork and spoon. An absolutely let down.

Salted egg soft shell crab
- Presentation definitely could be improved. The picture showed a dry version so I was surprised when it came out covered in sauce.
- Taste and flavour is good.

Overall, I wouldn’t go back there again. Paid 980k for these 3 dishes including a pink guava tea."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"We visited just a little past lunchtime on a weekday and we were greeted by lovely staff. The food was spectacular though we ordered way too much. Crab was wonderful, and so was the fresh pomfret. The baby pumpkin ( which was actually baby zucchini was delicious, and so were the razor clams with morning glory. The crab asparagus soup was also delightful. All in all, a great meal with fabulous value for money. Note it is a seafood specialty place- whilst there are non seafood choices we’d highly recommend ordering seafood"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"One of the best local Vietnamese restaurants in the Vung Tau area, especially for seafood lovers. The dishes were incredibly delicious, and everyone enjoyed the meal. The only downside was that desserts were not served after the meal, which was a bit disappointing. Otherwise, everything else was great!"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"The staff is friendly and also explained clearly about what is their recommendation. The food is fresh and tastes good. The price is also reasonable. Not so crowded after lunch hour which is good for someone who likes a quiet dining environment. Must order baby pumpkin, tastes good!"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Waitress immediately turned on A/C when I asked. She also read my mind and turned down the Viet pop music. She seemed a little unhappy (about her job?) though.

Food portion (baby pumpkin', i.e. zucchini) was small to moderate and rather expensive at 85K. Mix of real fresh garlic and fried dried. Smelled good. Tasted excellent. What I especially liked was how it was hot temperature and not sloppy wet.  I will order this same vegetable, with its crunchy ends - somewhere else next time. I might come back here for scallops *if someone else is paying*.

Note: photo of cooked vegetable is before I took a bite."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,Great seafood restaurant. Nice atmosphere with friendly staff (that do speak English if you need). They also have western beer on tap as well. Tried many different dishes and I enjoyed them all. If you are in the area give them a look.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Never, ever trust the Google reviews or ratings for this restaurant. The ratings are blatantly false and misleading. The food is absolutely terrible, and the prices are absurdly high. We came here as a family, hoping for a nice seafood meal, but ended up having a thoroughly miserable experience. This restaurant tarnishes the reputation of beautiful Vung Tau. It was so bad that after eating here, our family had no choice but to return to our hotel and eat instant noodles."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"I visited this restaurant after seeing its high reviews. I ordered the stir-fried noodles with vegetables and the crab meat soup with mushrooms. The portion size of the stir-fried noodles was quite large, enough for 2-3 people, but it was a bit greasy and salty for my taste. The soup was good but resembled more of an egg drop soup than what I expected. Also, be aware that the restaurant charges 3000 VND for using the wet towels provided, as well as for the bag of crackers placed on the table. Additionally, they add a 3% fee for credit card payments. While my waitress was kind, one of the waitstaff, who spoke some English, wasn’t very friendly."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"We came two times during the trip. Really fresh seafood, price is fair and most importantly very open and transparent. Environment is clean and nice. The food taste is more common Asian taste rather than a lot sweet sour local food .   Service person speaks decent English .

Almost every dish we order is great . Especially love the fresh crab, oyster, and pork ribs clay pot."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Quach Seafood in Vung Tau is a great spot for those who prefer a quiet, uncrowded place with fresh seafood and friendly service. The food is decent, the atmosphere is cozy with air-conditioning, and there’s convenient street parking. Perfect for couples or families looking for a relaxed dining exễprience."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"If there were more stars to tick, I would.  The staff are beautiful and super helpful. We didn't order anything as we were suggested a few things, and it was as if they were in our head.
Oysters to start, Prawns in the middle and finished off with a whole groper fish. Nearly forgot about the fried rice. Probably the best I've had. 👌

I'll be back next time I'm in Vung Tau."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Fresh seafood, super delicious, we came with my boyfriend and ordered 6 dishes of seafood including 1 big crab. The bill out is only 1.34 Million. What's a surprise!

However, this restaurant is not seaside. Don't expect for the good view"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Recently dined at this gem of a seafood restaurant in Vung Tau, and I couldn't be happier with the experience! From the moment we walked in, the staff greeted me with the warmest smiles. Every dish I tried was a delightful journey for my taste buds, especially the salted egg blue crab. The service was exceptional throughout the meal, with the staff going above and beyond to ensure our dining experience was nothing short of perfect. A must-visit for seafood lovers visiting Vung Tau. Highly recommended!"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,Small but nice restaurant. Staffs are very supportive. Highly recommend.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"This is the best seafood I've ever had, the crab and lobster are so big it takes 3 of us to finish it. The salted egg sauce for the crab tastes like heaven 👌👌. The other seafoods  are also very delicious.

The staffs are very accommodating and can speak a little basic english (so don't worry if you are a foreigner). Very recommended if you are looking to have a delicious, fulfilling and affordable seafood."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,The grilled pomfret in chili salt was very fresh and done to perfection. I also enjoyed the oysters in onion sauce. The oysters in cheese are good too but the taste was more sour than I expected. Extremely friendly service.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,We had a delicious dinner and our waitress Dang Tran was lovely. Her English was very good. It's the slow season (hence the low rating for atmosphere) so we were the only people upstairs - but there was a party of locals down stairs.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Dinner with my family, everything very good
Food quality, services , staff also.
Highly recommend."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"I came here due to the good reviews and wasn’t disappointed! The staff were so friendly and sweet. The fish was also a good size and delicious. Their English was really good so it was great to have a chat with them.

I have allergies and they were helpful negotiating them and even gave me watermelon for desert. I highly recommend the restaurant."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"One of the very few good restaurants in Vung Tau in my opinion! 4.9 is a bit too much I think, I would probably rate this as a 4.3-4.4 back home.

+ the salmon with lemon butter sauce was quite good, but a bit expensive
+ the pork spring rolls and the vegetable stir fried noodles were good
+ good coffee (americano) and mango smoothie
+ the waiters are very friendly, they speak english and the service is very fast

- I ordered 400 grams of tiger prawns and got 10 prawns. They were smaller than I expected and it is really hard to peel them because they don’t cut the shrimps in half. They were tasty, but I got way better price quality ratio in Ho Chi Minh, which is surprising to me given that Vung Tau is near the sea and most restaurants here serve seafood"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Wow Wow Wow This is a must visit if you're in Vung Tau !!
We had a recommendation from a local ex pat and it did not disappoint.
Oyster with Wasabi, Prawn Cocktail which we had to order a second as we shared the oysters & cocktail, Salmon with Garlic sauce, Chicken with Garlic , Tiger Prawns with Chilli salt
Everything was cooked to perfection 👌  & the lovely owner & her staff were so friendly & attentive. Seafood fresh is so fresh , & the facility is so clean 💙They then gave us a free desert of chocolate/caramel peanut slice YUM YUM YUM 😋  Please visit 🙏 We will be back next time we visit ... Thankyou &  Love from Oz 🇦🇺"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Food were good and extremely well prepared. Can assist English speaking customer. For me authentic Vietnamese food. Prices are reasonable  800k dong, oysters, scallops, seafood salad, 2 order spring roll, baby squid and drinks. Free bite dessert."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,Visited Vung Tau on 4/29. Had my luch and dinner here. The day time menu is serving for brunch and the dinner menu is for sea food mainly. Good quality food with cozy environment. Surely will   come back with friends for my next trip to Vung Tau.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"I really enjoy and love here very good service and food staff also really nice friendly, im sure to come back this place again. (Im from Thailand 😊)"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,It was our first time here and it was an amazing experience! The food was fresh and suited our taste perfectly. The staff was very nice and welcoming as well. Would definitely recommend friends and family members to visit here!!
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,This reasturant is very nice food & high quality service 😀
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"The best restaurant in Vung Tau! Food is epic (seafood is super fresh, cooked to perfection!), atmosphere is nice, open and clean and staffs are extremely attentive and friendly (especially Huong is the star 😊). If we return to Vung Tau, we will absolutely return to this place and recommend to everyone who plans to visit Vung Tau."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"good food, great vibe. Lovely staffs, the service is 10/10 for me :) Highly recommended"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"I am not sure if the people and service or the food is better. I felt so welcomed. The people were great, friendly and easy to communicate with. Almost never I write reviews but this place does deserve its title 5stars seafood place in Vung tau"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,Service was great. The waitress took initiative to take picture for us and recommended a few dishes. Fish was fresh & tender. We love it.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"My family and I, all the way from Kien Giang, had an amazing dining experience at Quach Seafood Restaurant. The oysters with wasabi were incredibly fresh and flavorful, providing a unique and delightful combination of tastes. The live prawns with salt and chili were cooked to perfection, with a perfect balance of seasoning and spice. The fried rice with garlic was a delicious accompaniment, adding a savory note to the meal. I couldn't be happier with the food; it's a solid 10/10 in my book! What's more, the staff was exceptionally professional, adding to the overall enjoyable atmosphere. And to top it off, the prices were so affordable! We were pleasantly surprised by the value for money we received. I highly recommend this restaurant for its exceptional seafood, wonderful flavors, top-notch service, and budget-friendly prices."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Lovely staff, extremely clean in all areas including bathroom. Food was great. The silver pomfret was absolutely amazing. I'd come back just for that! Definitely recommend this place ❤️"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Excellent indoor atmosphere. Very clean place to dine in and felt very comfortable eating here. Seafood here is very fresh and big sized. Cooked deliciously. Lastly, service is very good. Really enjoyed it here and will be back if I ever come to vietnam again 😃

P.S. only took photos of some food"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Quality, fresh and sumptuous seafood! We came here twice across our time here in Vung Tau. Tried different dishes each time and do recommend the baby squid as well as the fresh grilled prawns. Staff were always so attentive and friendly towards us. Do give them a visit for a wonderful seafood meal!"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,This restaurant will be my favourite seafood restaurant from Vung Tau from now on. Food and service from staff are amazing! I will definitely come back to this restaurant everytime I visit Vung Tau :)
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,We found this restaurant based off the Google reviews and it did not disappoint. Amazing seafood and wonderful staff! Highly recommend.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Quach's Seafood was a great mix of great quality, super-fresh seafood (we had Crab, King Prawns, Oysters and Razor Clams), served by hard working, efficient but also smiling and friendly staff who can all speak a little English. The owner can speak more English if needed and as a former worker at Belly's Watering Hole, she knows a bit about customer service! Beer goes for 20,000D for local and they also have some mid range wines if you prefer that. This proved to be an excellent evening out and I thoroughly recommend it!"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,We had a great dinner here recently and then returned the next day for lunch! The restaurant had a lovely ambience and the staff were very helpful and advised on the menu and spoke English.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"This establishment will place on the bill secret charges that you don't know about. BEWARE. Charged for petty items like serviettes, wet towels, and peanuts. Will not come back. We gave them big tip! and didn't notice the other charges until  we got home."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,Great seafood! We were able to pick out the fish we wanted. Neat experience. Excellent service and the food was delicious
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Amazing friendly staff. Greet you right at the entrance and show you to your seat. Smiling while giving tips on what to order.

Had baby pumpkin with garlic. Delicious!!!

The place is clean with freshly made food"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"The ratings are a bit exaggerated. It took them 20mins to bring us our first dish, and the restaurant was not that crowded. Other tables waited 15-20 as well. The food was good, but barely good enough to justify wait time.

Edit: they finally brought out the softshell crabs. They were soooo small (my lady friend's tiny hand for scale)."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"We had an amazing experience going there for lunch. Every single dish from the vegetables, fish, fried rice down to the drinks were delicious! Pricing is transparent and service is the most friendly! 10/10 highly recommend!"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Amazing food, great service! Highly recommended!"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Absolutely amazing...the reviews are correct.
Amazing staff...and prices. We lashed out and ordered our favourites including live lobster.  We couldn't fault 1 dish and really felt like we had the freshest and best quality seafood around.
Our server Thu was a beautiful lady and so friendly.  Our first night in Vung Tau (no...its not our 1st visit.
Price was great for what we had.
We will be back before we leave.
Paul & Nat...Australia"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,Enjoy the amazing fresh seafood here. The restaurant is clean and the service is professional. I’ll definitely recommend friends to experience a quality meal here.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Very friendly staff with good English.  👍  Each portion of food is pretty big, so please be aware... I am sure each dish can be shared by 2-3.
Sea food Hotpot is recommended"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"We visited the restaurant 2day ago. Seafood is fresh, staff is very friendly ( The lady is so good english, she introduced for us the delicious dishes, I thought she is boss but she doesn’t),
We will come back when we have a chance. Should try the seafood when you be there."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Like all other places associated with Quach, this restaurant is high quality with great service."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"This is definitely one of the best restaurants in Vung Tau City. The grilled fish in garlic sauce was the best that I’ve ever eaten in my whole life. And also the baked prawn with cheese was awesome! I’ll be here for more plenty of times, that’s for sure!
I’m also want to compliment the staff, they are lovely and very kind"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"We are living temporarily in VũngTàu (Vietnam) and we often have our meals at Quach's... wonderful food, perfect service, air-conditioned and very pleasant environment!!!  We love!!"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,Beautiful food and service. The bill left me with a sour taste in my mouth. We were charged for 2 wet towels and a bag of peanuts that we didn't want! And thought were complimentary! These items were left on our table! We were never advised that these items were chargeable! I am not impressed and this is WARNING to all diners! Every other establishment we have dined in would have been complimentary. I'm surprised they didn't charge me to use the toilet. Please be forwarned.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Excellent fresh seafood.
Nice service and interior.
I think there is also a second floor with view ovrr the lake."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Very nice restaurant, reasonable price, the food tasted great and good services. They also give us a free dish of dessert, I would come back here on the next time to Vung Tau. Highly recommend Quach’s seafood"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Very cleaned and nice restaurant in town. We got here during lunch time weekday so it was quiet but the foods were delicious and fresh. Loved the shrimps, baby octopus and fried rice 💯 Highly recommend this restaurant."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,Very tasty meals. great variety of seafood. and the best rice and snails in town. friendly and smiling staff.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Great place and food as fresh as it gets. It was the first time we tried crabs and I dont think it would be a successful attempt without help of amazing waitress who not only helped us order but also helped us with deconstructing the crabs.
Very interesting experience, would definitely recommend."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"We first tried this restaurant after reading the reviews on google and we love all their seafood, service and the place. We could request for no meat because we are muslim. We went there again for 2nd time to try different menu. And 3rd time we tried ordering delivery to hotel through google chat. All food (seafood) are very delicious, the staff was very welcoming and friendly. The place also very clean. Will definitely come again if we visit vung tau next time. We love their fried rice and squid steam."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"best seafood fried rice in Vungtau, workers are extremely nice and welcoming 💜"

ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"4 kiwis from New Zealand staying in Vung Tau.  Discovered Quach's and what a find it was.  Was so good the first time that we had to go back.  Great food, so fresh and tasty.  Reasonably priced and lovely clean restaurant.  Even recommended other friends to dine there and they loved it too!  Will definitely go again."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Delicious foods in beautiful City..😋😋

ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Get the lobster, it's truly great and an experience you will remember!"

ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,The food and drink is very nice.A good choice for having breakfast in Vung Tau.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Oh my god, Troi oi! So good food! I not realise how much I loved lobster, until I visit this place. mười đêm! Thank you friendly staff members, shout out to Miss Thu for the invite."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,The seafood is very fresh. Especially the blue crab . Also Recommend shrimp with chili salt
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,This is the best restaurant in Vung tau!!  This is a hidden gem! Large selection to choose from and the staff was great!  This is a must if you are visiting Vung Tau.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Very good service, fresh food, cheap prices, and we sell our own clothes"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Everything was fresh and delicious, and the prices can't be beat!"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,We stopped here for lunch recently. The dishes that we ordered were just ok and nothing to be raving about. The seafood dishes did not taste that fresh and quite chewy. Service was quite nice and courteous.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,Seafood and fresh and staff are friendly
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Italians here! The food was so good: the fired seafood rice, the sweet and sour squillo, the prawns and the crans above all! The wine was good too, so the service! Very clean restaurant! The waitresses were really nice and welcoming! Recommended!"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"This place is really on point we had an amazing meal.
I highly recommend if you want a quality clean seafood restaurant and cannot go past this place"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,Great local cuisine and very friendly polite staff. AC on and comfortable setting.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,Seafood was great and staff pleasant and efficient.  It was nice to sit in a fully enclosed restaurant with aircon.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,Great food and quality reasonable price specially clean and fresh mood and hot music
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Foods are great, delicious and clean. The atmosphere and staffs are wonderful. Highly recommended."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"The best sea food restaurant! And prizes are very good. The shrimps with garlic were just amazing, thank you ❤"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Obviously, the people who are so complimentary of this restaurant have certainly never been to the many small seafood restaurants in the area, probably because they fear having to sit on plastic chairs. Too bad for them because, if the visual quality of the dishes is indeed good, the taste is mediocre and the price much too high. I walk past the restaurant every day and there are very rarely several customers. That there are so many positive comments is more than suspicious."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Food is excellent, and service is excellent! I’d recommend them!!"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,Really nice food. Good service friendly staff.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,Affordability that tasted heavenly
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,It has aircon! The food was great and the staff were even better.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"The food was excellent, they even have vegetarian options which are some of the best I've had in Vietnam. The beer is very cheap too."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Excellent food, I had amazing king prawns. Attentive and lovely staff. Menu in English too. Hefty portions, left full and satisfied."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"The service is awesome!! Impressive!!
Food is also delicious.
Staff speak good English."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Excellent food, Super friendly staff, Great beers at very reasonable prices. Highly recommended."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"We had the best Seafood & service here. The food delicious & fresh from tank, crab , prawns & fish .Girls had very good English which is a bonus as from Australia.Very happy customers! Thank you"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,Great place for turists to try local Vung Tau food. Very nice service
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,Wonderfully fresh seafood and super helpful and friendly staff. Highly recommended
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"👏👏👏Don’t be fooled by the humble front, this is no basic eatery this is a real restaurant, a hidden gem. It can get super busy though. The atmosphere and AC downstairs are very cozy. The staff is very chill and pro at the same time. And trust them when they say everything is good. My husband don’t eat seafood but loooved the fish dishes. Even the humble homemade chocolate peanut treats are so bomb. So much we went back just to get some for a quick snack. And super fresh and clean too. Don’t miss out"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Food was ok, good service, spacious breezy restaurant"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,Great food great service! The waiter will gladly explain the prices of the seafood.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,If you are seafood lover you definitely like the restaurant
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"We are from Indonesia, we having lunch, and it was very nice in taste. We will come back."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,It tast very good and friendly.So we had good time here.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,Great restaurant !
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Sensational staff . We were fortunate to be served by Dan, spoke English Fluently and her suggestions for fabulous.. the food was spectacular. So so fresh and flavourful. We are from Australia and appreciate the freshness and quality at a great price . So do yourself a favour and rock up ."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Number one the seafood fresh in VT
Perfect the place to enjoy the food
Staff really really funny and take care good customers."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Really good experience!
Nice food, nice services and hygene is very good!"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"We ate here because of the reviews sadly it was the worst food we have eaten in Vietnam. The snails we rubbery like overcooked squid, the chips with the fish & chips were frozen packaged type. The waitress as average. We had seafood before at Hai San Thanh Phat 1 and sadly compared to that Quach’s is a 2. Expensive, and mediocre."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,A cozy restaurant with various seafood in a quiet street. The price is a little high. 3% added when paid by card.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"The service is great, the staff is very friendly. But the food is just average. And they charge you for items that are usually complimentary in other restaurants. I don't see a reason why the rating is so high"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,seems pricey
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"This unassuming seafood restaurant looks just like countless others, BUT, the food and service are amazing."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Inside, we really love the interior decorations that was casual, bright and lively. There’s a huge lobster cartoon painted on the main wall of the restaurant and if you look really carefully, you’ll find a few “Nemo’s” (clown fish) on the mural as well. The staff were also really friendly, making recommendations for the dishes. Thanks to the recommendation, we tried something that we’ve not really tasted before but really enjoyed. Upon being seated, we were given the menu and in our minds, we had an idea of what we wanted to have. From the reviews, we saw that the grilled prawns were ordered quite frequently and we ordered a dish of 7 prawns. The staff did share that these were frozen and not live prawns but we were quite happy with our selection thereafter.

We also knew that we wanted to have some crabs as we don’t normally have them in Singapore. Unlike what we saw from the menus online, Quach’s have actually improved their menu by including the /kg prices of the live crabs, lobsters and prawns. This is unlike what it did previously with “market prices”. With this, the prices would probably be a little higher but for customers, you know that there would be no haggling of prices here.

Moreover, to add to the transparency, we were asked which type of mud crabs we wanted (female with roe are slightly more expensive) and they were picked and weighed out on the scale in our presence. The bucket was “zeroed” first so that the scale with the bucket was at “0kg”, allowing the weight of the crabs to be displayed when placed within the bucket. We also asked if we could have two different crabs with two different styles of preparations – to which the staff readily agreed. Later, we found that there was no additional charges for this arrangement as well...

For more details on what we had at Quach's Seafood Restaurant Vung Tau, visit 2bearbear today!"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Had one of the best dining experiences in Vietnam. Flavors were on point and delicious, staff were all so warm and attentive, the place had such a warm, homey and comfortable vibe. Prices were also very reasonable. Will definitely go back here when I get to visit Vung Tau again. Aside from the fresh and tasty seafood, I think what really impressed me is the hospitality that the staff showed. I hope you can keep providing travellers with hearty seafood meals and amazing service for many many more years to come. I highly recommend this awesome restaurant!"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,Staff is very accommodating and friendly. They welcome us with a smile. Must try is the deep fried baby squid. My personal favorite is egg fried rice.
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Great food, well prepared, attention to details. Very well-trained and responsive staff. Most of the food I ordered was good, except the stingray hotpot. It was mediocre."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"I had high expectation from this restaurant. It’s one of the highest rated seafood restaurants in Vung Tau even though it costs close to double of its competitors (Oc Thu Nhien). This is why I decided to go there to have a seafood dinner.

Unfortunately for me, I left disappointed. I should have known when the restaurant was empty during dinner time on a Saturday night. Though the service staff are attentive, helpful and can speak English, I am penalising the restaurant because of the food. Let’s break down what I ordered one by one:

Crab meat fried rice
- There was barely any crab meat in there. A few shredded pieces.
- The fried rice was very dry.

Garlic butter small lobster
- The seasoning was great.
- Portion size for 2-3 people.
- Toughest small lobster I have ever had in my life. Just to cut the flesh, I thought I was going to break my metal fork and spoon. An absolutely let down.

Salted egg soft shell crab
- Presentation definitely could be improved. The picture showed a dry version so I was surprised when it came out covered in sauce.
- Taste and flavour is good.

Overall, I wouldn’t go back there again. Paid 980k for these 3 dishes including a pink guava tea."
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"We visited just a little past lunchtime on a weekday and we were greeted by lovely staff. The food was spectacular though we ordered way too much. Crab was wonderful, and so was the fresh pomfret. The baby pumpkin ( which was actually baby zucchini was delicious, and so were the razor clams with morning glory. The crab asparagus soup was also delightful. All in all, a great meal with fabulous value for money. Note it is a seafood specialty place- whilst there are non seafood choices we’d highly recommend ordering seafood"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"One of the best local Vietnamese restaurants in the Vung Tau area, especially for seafood lovers. The dishes were incredibly delicious, and everyone enjoyed the meal. The only downside was that desserts were not served after the meal, which was a bit disappointing. Otherwise, everything else was great!"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"The staff is friendly and also explained clearly about what is their recommendation. The food is fresh and tastes good. The price is also reasonable. Not so crowded after lunch hour which is good for someone who likes a quiet dining environment. Must order baby pumpkin, tastes good!"
ChIJxRCdzNtvdTERZMLiqhp-eVw,"Waitress immediately turned on A/C when I asked. She also read my mind and turned down the Viet pop music. She seemed a little unhappy (about her job?) though.

Food portion (baby pumpkin', i.e. zucchini) was small to moderate and rather expensive at 85K. Mix of real fresh garlic and fried dried. Smelled good. Tasted excellent. What I especially liked was how it was hot temperature and not sloppy wet.  I will order this same vegetable, with its crunchy ends - somewhere else next time. I might come back here for scallops *if someone else is paying*.

Note: photo of cooked vegetable is before I took a bite."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"The place was nice and pretty. The vibe is good with perfect service and beachy decor. Food taste good with some hits or misses but great overall. Highly recommend the salted eggs sauce, perfectly seasoned. The price point was good too. Good family spot!"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Was looking for a nice and quiet seafood restaurant which is still a short walk to many cafes and the beach.

We order prawn, chicken wing, squid, clam and morning glory. Each using different method of cooking. Salt & Spice, Roast with salt, Grill, Thai Sauce and stir fry.

2 nice waitress serve us and speak some English.
So that makes the experience wonderful and pleasant."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"A beautiful wee local place, lovely decorations and very clean.

The staff were very attentive, and the food is some of the best I've had since arriving in Vietnam. Some of our crew have been several times now, and they've translated the menu which was very much appreciated and shows just how good the staff are! If that's not going above and beyond, I don't know what is."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,We had dinner twice in this lovely restaurant. It is a really must-try location for visitors to get this city. Price is really cheap with fresh and delicious seafoods. Service is also fast although it is always crowded. I will visit it again.
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Very pleased with delicious seafood and snails !!!
I and some foreigner friends visited this restaurant last week. High judge for seafood choice.
Good view, good space
Fresh seafood and snails.
Staffes is friendly and polite, serviced quickly.
We were pleasure with staffes' behavior
Seafood are fresh , cooked well. Not too much spices.
It's very convenient from here to front beach and our hotel.
We like: softed beef with sauce, fried oyster with cheese, grilled eggs with butter, very delicious and some food that i don't know what name ( pictures including)
The price is reasonable.
High recommend !
We had awesome experience. We will visit again."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Went here based on other reviewers but things you should really know.

Nearly all reviewers are locals (reviews  translated to English) and indeed everyone there was a local which is a good thing i suppose.  It was fairly full.

Its an open air restaurant so no conditioning . There is no English menu and only a few pictures so we just picked a few dishes from the Google reviews. Beer is warm and they add ice. Staff are nice and make an effort to speak English

It's very cheap and food is decent but nothing  that you can't find anywhere else to be honest.

PS the snails everyone else is getting its good but it's notice the locals also order bread 🍞 too. Good idea"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,Very nice place with good food. The grill prawns are very tasty and fresh. Will come back here again
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,Great meal! Very friendly staff! Fantastic experience overall.
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"What a fantastic spot for dinner, brimming with local charm!

The space is spacious and airy. You simply must experience it for yourselves; rest assured, you won't be disappointed. And don't miss out on the mouthwatering ""Oc Huong Sot Trung Muoi"" - it's absolutely divine!"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Superb place been here 3 nights in a row, fantastic staff and food"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Really nice restaurant. Staff also amazing, they’re provided such a good service. Love it here!"

ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Found this restaurant from google maps. Food tasted good but octopus was spoiled, we complained and they removed it from our bill. Overall quite a good experience"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,very good food and atmosphere! staff are friendly.
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Lovely restaurant near the beach, great seafood and friendly staff"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,The food is pretty good. Seafoods are fresh & well cooked. Staffs also nice with good recommendations & also advised which I should order or not (becoz I had 2 kids). I will comeback for more if I had free time to visit Vung Tau.
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,Tasty and affordable
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"I walked a long way here, but not open!!"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,Food was good and the prices were great. Didn’t love the fried rice.
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,This is a good place to try some seafood and chill
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,Food was not good take your tourist money elsewhere.  Food kept also coming out slow and one by one.
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,Ok
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,Ok
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Very good food, a lot of flavor. Very clean and very good service"

ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Outstanding food, cheap prices"

ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,Ngonnnn nnnnnnnnnn
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,Good food great service.
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"The restaurant is spacious, airy, the staff is friendly, the food is served quickly, the spices are good. Fresh and delicious seafood. Reasonable prices. Crab, stir-fried water spinach, blood cockles, scallops, clams, fried rice, 1 beer, 2 people for 1,060,000 VND)"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"The space is also moderate, but the upstairs is more airy. The food is average, compared to the price it is okay. However, the salted egg sauce is not delicious, has a musty smell. The food comes out quickly. The parking space is a bit tight because the road is small. Everything is also average, not very impressive. Okay."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"The restaurant has an open space so it's quite airy, the staff is enthusiastic, and the service is quick 🌟
The dishes are well-seasoned and served quickly.
Recommend the clams/clams stir-fried with tomyum. Because I ran out of clams, I switched to clams!!!"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"The restaurant serves dishes quickly, the staff is enthusiastic, and the dishes are served quickly. Fresh anchovy salad, Thai sauce shrimp are also fresh shrimp caught from the lake, the remaining dishes are delicious, my baby really likes the cheese sauce. 10 points for the restaurant 🥰"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"There is also lake seafood (but the types are probably seasonal). When I visited, there were a lot of fish and today I visited again and saw many types of clams, grilled delicious, steamed succulent, and delicious. In addition to the menu with escalating prices, the restaurant still maintains its stance of not changing prices. As for the service staff, well... 10 points for sophistication, this season the view is sometimes hot, sometimes rainy, but please understand the restaurant."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Delicious food, suitable for taste, reasonable price, the staff here are very cute, the food comes out quickly"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"I find the food tasty and good quality. The portion is reasonable for the price. One portion can feed 4 people. I like the stir-fried crab pieces the best, lots of crab."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"The food here is delicious, reasonable price. Recommend grilled oysters with miso cheese sauce, very fatty and aromatic. Stingray hotpot has fragrant broth but little fish meat. The staff is very enthusiastic and attentive, extremely cute, 100/100 service"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Delicious snails, clean restaurant, but it took a while to come out. I hope the restaurant will serve food faster :V"

ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Food is quite delicious, clean, price is ok, staff is attentive."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"The food is not fresh, the squid and shrimp are soft and not fresh like they have been left for a long time. Only the Huong snail dish is edible. The tiktoker news and booking reviews are always bad."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"The shop is spacious and airy, central location is convenient for moving around and choosing the shop.
+ The menu is diverse, the spices are just right, and the dishes are delicious.
+ Service quality: ok, staff support is enthusiastic, nice, dishes are quite slow.
+ View: located in the center, not facing the sea, but the layout is neat and cool, suitable for going with family, friends,...

In short, if you come here to experience it, you'll have to wait about 10-15 minutes to get a table when you come in on the weekend."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Delicious food, fast service, enthusiastic and attentive staff"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"The restaurant has lots of cool green trees and parking space. The food quality is quite good, with fatty and fragrant pork fat. The fish price is very reasonable."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"+ very spacious and cool space.

+ service: enthusiastic, cute and attentive
+ food: although the restaurant has about 25 tables, the food is served very quickly and the staff remembers the dishes very well.

Understand why they have opened 4 branches.

What a great experience.
Go eat according to google map, not tiktok review"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Delicious food, enthusiastic staff, comfortable restaurant space"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Went at noon but the space was still cool, the staff was enthusiastic, went on the weekend and waited about 10-30 minutes for all 6 dishes to be served, which was quite fast, the food portion was reasonable for the price. Worth the experience and will try again early next month (after the 5th) <3"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Fresh seafood, reasonable price."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"I saw a lot of reviews on tiktok, when I came to eat, all the dishes were okay but not delicious, the price was also relatively high."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Every time my family comes here! Favorite restaurant
Delicious, tasty, fresh food
Friendly staff - little Ly
Especially the food is super fast"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Open space, cool sitting upstairs, quick staff, quick food, ate twice, delicious, fresh food"

ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"The food is delicious, the restaurant is spacious and comfortable, the staff is enthusiastic, and the food is served quickly"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Seeing the high reviews, I stopped by to try it out, but was completely disappointed. The food was really bad, the price wasn't cheap, never coming back."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"I saw on tiktok that everyone said it was delicious, nutritious and cheap so I went with them but was disappointed and didn't know what to say. The restaurant was crowded but the food didn't come out too long. The food was nothing special, the portion was a bit small, and the price was high. The noodles had a lot of water spinach, the snails were big but I don't know if it was because they were crowded but they had a strange smell and tasted bland. The steamed clams were bland even though they were big. The most disappointing thing was the crab claws, the amount of meat wasn't enough to fit between my teeth. The total of 7 dishes was 700 more but the food was okay but not delicious and worth the money."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Delicious food, reasonable price, attentive staff, will come back next time"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Delicious food, reasonable price. Staff is cheerful and enthusiastic, food is served very quickly. The restaurant atmosphere is very warm. 10 points, no complaints"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"To put it bluntly, the restaurant hires seeders too much even though the quality is not commensurate.

My group visited the restaurant because they saw that the reviews on the map were quite high, so they also stopped by to try it out, but the experience was very bad.

- The price of the dishes is not cheap, but the amount of food is too little, the taste is not too delicious but just okay, even a bit bland with some dishes, to put it bluntly, the price is very expensive compared to the quality, not at all stable prices like many seeding reviews
- The service is quite bad, the food takes a long time to be brought out even though the restaurant is not too crowded and I only went on a weekday, the hot pot was brought out but even after 10-15 minutes the noodles still hadn't come out, and there was no hot pot ladle, even the things that should be prepared like dipping sauce were completely absent, I had to proactively ask for it
+ The only plus point I see in this restaurant is that the security guard is very cheerful, enthusiastic, and cute.

Even though the experience was very bad about the quality of the restaurant, if there were any good points, I would still give it a fair review. The attached photo is to prove that my group actually visited and ate at the restaurant, not to give a negative review or anything. This is my review from the perspective of a customer who has experienced the restaurant. I hope the restaurant will take note to really improve the quality of the food as well as the service process, not hire seeding to attract customers like they are doing."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Clean restaurant, delicious food, enthusiastic take care staff. Especially the restaurant serves food very quickly. Will definitely come back next time."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"The food is delicious, suitable for the taste, reasonable price, the staff here are very cute. It was so delicious that the table was empty."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"The food is okay but the portion is a bit small for 4 people, but the price is reasonable. The waiter is quick and easy to please. The atmosphere is not impressive but neat and clean is okay."

ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Delicious food, suitable for taste, reasonable price, the staff here are very cute, the food comes out quickly"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"The restaurant is quite nice and airy. The food is delicious, the price is reasonable, but the Thai octopus sauce is a bit bland."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Fresh and delicious food, I have been there several times and will continue to support."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"I am a tourist, visiting the restaurant on a holiday with NO SURCHARGE NO VAT, I chose 2 airy spaces with wind, tables for 2-6 people, sitting near the counter for quick payment
+ I came to the restaurant at 6:30 am, those who eat early should go at this time, the order is good, each dish is delivered to the table quickly and conveniently, 10 points for the waiters on the 2nd floor
+ I ordered 6 dishes, total bill 420k, too cheap and delicious, 10 points for each dish
*Snails with egg sauce
*Mantis shrimp with lice
*Snails stir-fried with coconut
*Oysters grilled with scallion oil
*Blood cockles with tamarind sauce
*Crab pieces (the crab is not really dry, order this dish in advance because it dries quickly)
+ The menu is reasonably priced, it is a bit slow, but when paying, please ask for a tip of 10 VND for sophistication
+ The drinks are ok, order quickly to order early because the restaurant is a bit crowded"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Cheap meal for two people, about 400, very delicious food, suitable for everyone's taste, including oysters, stir-fried crab pieces"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"The food is sweet, with coconut milk, and it becomes a sweet soup shop.
The staff is boring, sitting without a bowl or towel, thinking the restaurant's style is to eat by hand. After a lot of begging, the staff was able to give me 4 bowls, while there were 6 people."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Disappointed, stir-fried dishes are very sweet, hot pot is also sweet, stir-fried clams with scallion oil are crazy sweet, the others are okay"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Delicious food, enthusiastic staff, spacious space"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"good food, good service"

ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Hoy hoy, no need to ask, every time I go I stop by for a drink, reasonable price, good food, no need to discuss, you should stop by."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Coming to Oc Diem 2, I immersed myself in the vibrant street food atmosphere typical of Vung Tau. The restaurant is always bustling with customers coming and going, the space is bustling with laughter, the sound of clinking glasses and the strong aroma of grilled and stir-fried seafood emanating from the kitchen. This is truly a familiar meeting place, imbued with a rustic and close atmosphere. 

The most impressive thing is the variety and freshness of the snails and clams. From fatty salted egg snails, fragrant grilled scallops with scallion oil, to rich garlic butter stir-fried cockles or simply a plate of sweet lemongrass steamed clams. Everything is fresh, processed on the spot, hot and retains the original sweetness of the ocean. 

The seasoning is just right, not too fussy but highlights the freshness of the seafood. Sitting with friends, choosing snails yourself, enjoying each hot dish with a cool glass of beer, it is a true ""sipping"" experience. Oc Diem 2 is not a luxurious place, but a place to fully experience the delicious taste of fresh seafood and the open, genuine atmosphere of Vung Tau."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"The food is fresh, the space is clean, the staff is friendly, the food comes out quickly. Overall, 10 points."

ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Food comes out quickly, no need to wait long, friendly staff, the mantis shrimp dish is quite delicious"

ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"The restaurant looks fancy but the food prices are very reasonable. I went with 2 people, ordered 4 dishes and 2 soft drinks, total bill 310k. Every dish was delicious, for me Grilled Scallops with Cheese was the best, like that, now I have had cheese sauce that suits my taste so well. Everyone, remember to try the restaurant's best-selling dishes, they are delicious. With such quality of service and space, it's a great deal. Will come back next time I come to Vung Tau 💯"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"The restaurant makes delicious food, the price is also quite reasonable. Especially the dishes with cheese, or salted egg sauce are very delicious.
The staff is cute, asked me ""Is the food to your taste?""
In the picture are 7 dishes, my group of 6 people ate for 630k."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"My family of 4 went for less than 900k, had snails, cheese oysters, Thai seafood sauce, hot pot, stir-fried squash. Every dish was super delicious and filling. Got 2 cans of beer or soft drinks for the Thai sauce dish. Without it, I couldn't eat it because it was too spicy."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Spacious restaurant, lots of seating. Upstairs. Can host parties, birthdays. Full lighting, cool fans, covered when it rains
Parking in front of the restaurant
Diverse menu, with highlight recommendations for easy selection. Excellent seasoning.
Small crabs so the price is reasonable
Friendly staff."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"My colleagues and I stopped by to try it out. Everyone liked the clams, fried rice, lagu chicken cartilage, grilled oysters.

ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Must say the food is delicious
Reasonable price for everyone"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,I read the reviews and saw a lot of praise. I went to eat and then regretted it. It was small and expensive. The hot pot broth was too sweet and bland. I wanted to try a new restaurant but was turned away.
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Every time my family has guests coming to Vung Tau, I take them to this restaurant. The food is delicious, the staff is enthusiastic and friendly. The price is reasonable. My parents also really like the space and food of the restaurant."

ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Went for lunch but the restaurant was very cool because there were many trees.

Will come back to support."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"The restaurant is airy and clean.
Menu with many options.
Delicious food.

- Food: The food is delicious, every dish is very ok, but I find the portion quite small, I can eat many dishes but not enough to fill me up"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"I stopped by the restaurant for lunch and dinner. The staff was ok, and there was someone watching the car so I felt very secure. The food here is delicious, the prices are reasonable, and the drinks are ok too. On holidays, you should book a table in advance or you won't have a table."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"It's amazing, it's absolutely delicious, 100 points, delicious taste on every finger. Don't regret half your life 🥰"

- The shop has an upper floor so the space is spacious
- But the restaurant doesn't have many other types of seafood such as snails, lobsters..."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Delicious food, lovely staff"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"I remember this as the best dinner I had on my last day in Vung Tau. It was reasonably clean (relative to other local restaurants), and although it was more expensive than other local restaurants, it was still affordable compared to other hotels or large seafood restaurants. The portions per dish were small, but the rice and noodles were generous. I liked it because the portions were small... In fact, you can eat a variety of delicious dishes, so I recommend it to families."
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"Fresh and delicious food, will come back if I have a chance to come to VT"
ChIJs7fn_7dvdTERtPKErENy8o0,"The restaurant is clean and airy, the food is served quickly. The seafood is fresh, delicious, a little sweet, to my family's taste. I will come back."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"We came here 2 days in row.
First day we ordered salmon pasta and bechamel sauce pizza.
Pasta was great, salmon was fresh and soft. Bechamel Pizza was a little bit bland, wish ham was a bit more salty.
Second day we ordered tuna pizza and risotto.
Tuna brought more flavor on pizza and was good. However risotto was underwhelming.
Staff seem well trained and friendly.
Overall it was a good place."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"We've eaten at Ristorante Luca several times, both for lunch and dinner.

Very good food, excellent service, and excellent prices.

Authentic Italian food.

I highly recommend this restaurant."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"For my taste, food quality weren’t matched with the prices. Could have been better. Tiramisu was the worst dish, too sweet, soft (not sure that they used ladyfingers, but if they do then it’s consistency was too strange), pasta was okay."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Amazing food taste, I didn’t expect how good it is. My family was enjoyed it a lot. Service is good too. You guy can find a delicious italian food at Luca. 100% recommended."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Excepting pizza, the food is perfectly cooked according to my taste 👅 The pizza’s crust is a little bit dry so I am not really into it. The price is neutrally appropriate, not expensive as I expect for that such atmosphere and the meal I ordered.

The server is so friendly and so do the boss. The space is airy and the location is easy to find, which is suitable for having a freaking chilling dinner eating and chatting with buddies or family. Recommending every guests to come!!!!"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"The pizza is good, but other parts of the menu are weak. I’d recommend just ordering pizza and drinks. Don’t order the stir-fried chicken with lemongrass. It came out drenched in oil and was terrible. Focus on the good stuff."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Great place, highly recommended. I went here twice, which I very, very rarely do when traveling.
It's a nice location, with outdoor rooftop terrace seating and indoor ac space. The staff, including the boss/owner (?) are very friendly and competent.
The food is delicious: I had chicken with cheese and ham on my first visit and a pizza the second time. The pizza had a nice thin crust, generous toppings and was yummy! They have nice appetizers, desserts and a reasonably priced wine list as well! And you can pay by card, too."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"We love the food and ate here many times during our stay. It never disappoints and is very affordable! If you want to eat proper Italian food, look no further! We will come back next year."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Coming from New York, I was in search of a good standard pepperoni pizza, it was very delicious and definitely similar to pizza back home. It was also spicy which I enjoyed. Worth the $6 for sure. I would like to try the lasagna next time :) I knew the food and service was going to be good when the worker was singing along to the music playing in the background 🤣"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Discovered this place on the second last day in Vietnam and wish we’d discovered this sooner. So far we’ve had Italian at multiple places and this was by far the best, in terms of service, taste and pricing. Their pizza was even better than what we had at 4Ps in Ho Chi Minh City. The Desserts and cocktails were outstanding too. Highly, highly recommend this place."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Pizza was very good, I was not so impressed with the seafood fried rice. We needed to ask for soy sauce, it was not given automatically. In general a good experience"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Pizza smells great, the crust was crunchy and the dough was thin. Nice place to have Pizza."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Very good Pizzas! Gor surprised with the taste of 4 cheeses and Margherita, probably the best 🍕 I tried in Vung Tau.
The restaurant is right next to the lake which is very chilly in the evening. Plenty of foreigners have dinner here."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Ordered take away pizza. Overall it was very good. The salami pizza was a bit too salty, but still good. The seafood pizza was everyone's favorite. Large size is okay, and is similar in size to an American medium. It's a bit pricey, but it's definitely a more authentic pizza than other restaurants here. They were very busy even on a weeknight, and of course this place is super popular among foreigners. However, considering how busy it was, and that we ordered 4 pizzas, the service was reasonably fast. The online ordering was also quite smooth."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"I was so surprised to find such a good Italian restaurant in Vũng Tàu. We arrived around 9 PM, and the restaurant was nearly full. We were lucky and thankful to a couple who saved us their table so we could sit together.

I noticed that the majority of customers were foreigners. The menu looked good, with a huge variety of options. I ordered a lot, and the food came out freshly made and quickly. Everything was so delicious that I forgot to take pictures of the dishes in their full appearance.

I loved the carpaccio—simple and light with fresh beef tenderloin, Parma cheese, light citrus sauce, and minced capers. The best dish, in my opinion, was the lasagne—absolutely the best I’ve ever had. The thin pasta layers were just al dente enough, the bolognese sauce was hearty and flavorful, and the melted cheese layer on top made for an unforgettable experience. I always order lasagne at Italian restaurants to gauge their flavor and style, and this one left me very satisfied and happy. Sometimes, a good dish can take your breath away and become a precious memory in life. I’m writing this review without having consumed any drinks—I just got emotional about one good dish.

The other dishes were also delicious. The pizza crust was thin and crispy at the edges, and the toppings were fresh. The homemade pasta was perfectly al dente. The spaghetti alle vongole was a bit too oily, but the ink spaghetti with salmon was good.

There are so many good things about this restaurant. We will definitely come back for more. Highly recommended

P.s: we did come back for more. It’s my first time ever trying the home made cavatelli pasta… a must try too.. not every Italian restaurant offers this kind of pasta."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Top quality restaurant, food, service, and ambience, a perfect 5 stars meal. Pizza crust is perfected and the vegetarian toppings are fresh, well cooked, and generous. Hands down my favorite restaurant in Vung Tau, Vietnam."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Amazing food, the service is great and they can communicate very well in english. We sat at the upper level which was very beautiful and comfortable. Good value as well, prices are very reasonable."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"The best restaurant in Vung Tau and among the very few restaurants here with good food!

I came here three times simply because the quality was really good and there weren’t other comparable options, except for 1 seafood restaurant.

+ I would recommend the lemongrass and chilli chicken. The portion is a bit small, but it is also quite cheap compared to other portions in the menu
+ the pizza is really good. Thin dough with a fluffy crust, quite tasty. I didn’t expect to find good italian food in Vung Tau to be honest.
+ the stir fried noodles with seafood were really tasty! Much better than at other Vietnamese restaurants in Vung Tau
+ for desert, the semifreddo croccante was delicious!
+ the waiters are really friendly and the service is very fast

- the fillet steak is not great in my opinion. It was better than I expected tbh given the location, but still a rather average steak overall I would say."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Definitely recommend for yall to come and try their food. Delicious and fresh!
Will be back trying their pizza"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Comforting Italian food. Great pizza. Great crust
Came back for the dessert soon
Need to up game their chili oil cause it's not hitting my Asian spicy tolerance"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Amazing as always, we came back as we loved the dining experience with the extended family back at Christmas. Highly recommended. Proper Italian quality dishes."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"They serve the best pizzas, better than the famous Pizza 4Ps around Vietnam, crusts are light and chewy. Drinks were really cold and refreshing for a really hot day, really appreciate that.

Service is excellent, however the aircon sitting area could be improved as it was a hot afternoon and the room felt warm too."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"The dinner here absolutely made my day!
I had a plate of grilled chicken and a large pizza, and both were exceptionally good. Delicate yet satisfying — every ingredient was in perfect harmony.
The staff were very welcoming and helpful, and their English was excellent.
I just feel a little bad for not being able to say a single word in Vietnamese — I hope I didn’t come across as rude.
Definitely recommend this place!"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Lovely delicious vegan pizza with no vegan cheese. Lovely setting. Friendly staff. Good French fries
Update 30 minutes later: I've changed it from a 5 star to a 3 star. Why? A western restaurant allowing people to smoke! Come on, this is supposed to be a family friendly restaurant! Allowing people to smoke in front of children is a big no no. I was going to return tomorrow night, but we will find somewhere else. Ban smoking upstairs too if you want more customers. Smokers understand and will go outside to smoke their cancer."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,This is the best pizza I have had in Vietnam. You can get a salad accompaniment and there is a good choice of beers. Prices are reasonable.
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,For me... This is the best Italian restaurant in Vũng Tàu by now 🌟👍 Strongly recommend ❤️
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"We and my kids love this place right on first time dine-in, excellent dishes and great staff service. Every dish is tasty, excellent pizza, great soup, salmon and so on… my daughter even order an extra seafood soup after she tastes it.
Love this place, we would come back definitely!!!"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Great space, friendly staff, good food for the price"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Authentic Italian food in Vung Tau, I admit it was a pleasant surprise. Price a bit high hence 4 stars although we order some overpriced drinks so next time will focus just on food. As a suggestion for atmosphere it could be good to add some Italian touches to the decor or play Italian music to counteract karoke from the neighbors."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Absolute treat. Lasagna is the dish to die for. Pizzas are well cooked using wood fired oven. Staffs and the manager/owner are very welcoming and attentiative to our needs.

Will definitely come back next time when I got the chance to try out steak menu."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"I reviewed Luca before, but I decided to do it again after I took a proper photo. I order their Margherita pizza often. It is very thin crust, and they usually put a couple of basil leaves on top for good measure, although I have gotten a few without the basil. The best thing about Luca is the SPEED. Unless they are busy, which happens from time to time, they will have your order at your place in 10 to 15 minutes from the time you order! Now I only live about a kilometer away but that is still impressive.

The pizza itself is thin and light (the crust will flop down because it is so thin) and the large is very easy for one man to eat in one sitting, with room to spare. They put a little extra sauce on the one in the photo. I like to scarf mine down with a nice cold German ale. Salute! 5 stars.

ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"A friend recommended me this place after she shut her own restaurant. Was not one bit disappointed! The food was awesome, the staff was friendly and helpful, and willingly assists you with a genuine smile.

I got the minestrone, seafood pasta, and a Napoli pizza. 9/10 for the food, missing 1 because I won’t be back so soon for a visit 🥲

Cutie pie mascot goes woo woo woo when you enter the restaurant haha 15/10 a good and handsome boi"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"We had a great dining experience here. The pizza was great, the service was excellent, and they were very accommodating with regards to vegan options. Highly recommended!"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"It's pretty simple to make a mushroom and Onion pizza. I asked for well done extra cooked crispy crust. What I got was half cooked with canned mushrooms (Yes mushrooms for my can. not fresh) and one tiny piece of onion on each piece. That is not cheese you are looking at. It is half cooked pizza dough. I asked them to cook it more and they said no. That's the way it is. The other issue I have as I was leaving I went to wash my hands. One of the staff came out of the toilet, did not wash his hands and went right back into the kitchen started handling food. This is only my opinion. See for yourself before you order. Go back and wash your hands. The soap dispenser is full of water. Take a look in the kitchen as you walk by."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Great food ! Pizza and pasta at the highest level! Great service and atmosphere ! And the owner- Italian from Napoli such a nice person, who takes care of everything 😊😊 Best restaurant in Vietnam 🇻🇳"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"We visited Luca Pizza & Italian Restaurant on a Wednesday night. Good we had a reservation because the place filled up quickly during our visit. They have a large menu with a variety of salads, pastas, pizzas, and desserts, along with some ""daily specials.""

We opted for two different pizzas: a pepperoni/spicy salami and a vegetarian that we added added chicken and gorgonzola. The pizzas themselves were well-made, with a thin crust and crispy edges. However, both pizzas lacked flavor. The vegetarian option, a bit overloaded with toppings, and the topping being to chunky to be on a pizza. The salami pizza suffered the same fate taste wise, and we felt the pizza sauce was to anonymous. It could have benefited from a bolder flavor profile, perhaps with more garlic and oregano. The gorgonzola we added on the pizza also lacked flavor.

While the pizza delivery was a bit delayed (which didn't bother us initially or that we said anything about), the staff went above and beyond to make amends. They offered us a complimentary dessert - an absolutely delicious ice cream cake with nuts - and even discounted our bill.

Overall, Luca Pizza & Italian Restaurant wins points for its friendly and attentive service. The dessert was a real highlight. However, the pizza itself needs some improvement, particularly with the flavor of the sauce and the balance of toppings. With a few adjustments, this restaurant could be a great option for Italian food in Vung Tau.

Service: 10/10
Food (pizza): 7/10
Dessert: 10/10"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"We visited this restaurant two times and we are really satisfied.We tried pizzas, lasagne, brucceta, coffe,beer and pistaccio desert. Service was amazing. Everything was great.Thank you for experience :)"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Well design restaurant, good food good staff, acceptable price range"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"We enjoy pizza, and bake it ourself at home on woodfired pizza. The pizza at Luca Pizza is the best I had in Vietnam. The dough is well riped and you can taste that. The deserts where amazing aswell. Will come back tomorrow!"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Truly excellent dining. The steak was super, the  black spaghetti and salmon were soo tasty. Deserts were top. Service was impeccable. The mains were so good I finished before taking pics... Mmmmm clean plates.."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Super nice place to eat pizza, spaghetti and other Italian food. We ordered also seafood platter that was very tasty. The staff is also very sweet and polite."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Simple decor but an extensive menu. Fast service by friendly waitresses who speak excellent English. The ""quattro stagioni"" pizza was tasty with adequate toppings."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"I had a nice lunch here. It is a good place for those looking for a more European style eatery after checking out the local restaurants. Also the clientele seemed to be more international compared to other restaurants and the waiters took the order in English without any problems. I really enjoyed the food, but the prices might be higher than elsewhere."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,We ate here twice during our short stay to Vung Tau and loved it. We had the penne alla vodka the first time and shared the spinach ravioli with butter and sage and a tropicana pizza the second time. All of which was great! Would recommend
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"If the restaurant is not run by a specialized Italian person, the restaurant will not work.

It is dramatic how in many restaurants and hotels in Vietnam, they lack specialized foreign staff.

Vietnamese people are not familiar with Italian culture and food, it is not their responsibility to take care of it, so they should learn to work with foreigners."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"After 2 weeks in Vietnam I wanted something that wasn't seafood or soup so we tried this place out.  We started with the Bruschetta followed by a Pepperoni pizza.  Both were excellent.  I have not seen pizza done correctly in Vietnam until today.  I could seriously eat it every day.  All told the pizza, bruschetta, 3 cokes and a coconut water was 360,000 VND, roughly $15 US.  Well worth taking the time to visit.  Service was great as well.  Highly recommend."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,The pizza here slaps. I came to Vung Tau just to eat it. The service staff is friendly and efficient. Overall it's an excellent experience and exactly what I want from dining out or getting takeout. I will always look forward to my next visit.
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Somewhat a fine dining experience. Their pizza is fresh and delicious. Pizzas aside, lasagna and some other foods are also worth a try, we ordered like 5 different dishes and all of them are very good."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,One of a few authentic Italian restaurants in town. It's not so crowded even at weekend. I would recommend this place if you are looking for a cozy place with decent food.
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Amazing food - the best pasta I have ever eaten - who knew this secret of Vietnam!
The serving staff were absolutely wonderful - attentive and friendly - highly highly recommend!!"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Truly one of the TOP restaurants in Vung Tau imho. If you took away the mosquitos, definitely a 5 star experience. The bread basket we received with our seafood soup was cold (we ordered more ciabatta and it was hot and crunchy, still chewy from being freshly cut. The soup was loaded with calamari, shrimp, and clams with generous amount of olives. Pizza crust is soft and chewy with a nice char for the smoky flavor. Squid ink pasta with salmon was divine, creamy... with the saltiness from grated parmesan making this our favorite dish. Overall a great experience with superb customer service."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"I ordered a takeaway pizza with a bottle of red, communication through whatsapp with the restaurant. And it was speedy response and delivery.

The pizza was so full of anchovies and super tasty. We added onions and spicy salami to it and my partner and I love it. I love my anchovies in italian pasta and pizza and find it hard to get a good puttanesca and pizza with anchovies in it, in Asia. Luca does it so well and the pizza was devoured fast. Super yummy. Highly recommended!! 😆

And we also got a bottle of Italian sangiovese which went superbly well with the pizza. Awesome possum!!
😄"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,Food arrived at a good pace and the chef knows how a carbonara should be made (no cream). Will be coming again
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"On a rainy night in Vung Tau, we visited Luca's. Greated by the owner and escorted to our seats. Staff were very happy and attentive. Food BEST PIZZA IVE HAD IN VIETNAM. My pizza was the diavola extra pepperni. Amazing. My gf also had a great with zuppa Di pecci dinner. The cocktails were great and cheap. Highly recommend for anything Italian in Vung Tau, and we will be back. Thanks Andy oh try the dessert menu too"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,The BEST pizza we have had on our travels through Vietnam and other areas of Asia. The pasta was top notch and lovely Italian wine.You can tell it's authentic Italian right down to the service. The location overlooking the pond was a nice touch too. Highly recommend
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"We have good time being here and enjoy the food. Delicious and nice atmosphere. Good point about the restaurant didn’t charge you any fee for paying by credit card, almost places in vung Tau will charge 3%"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Atmosphere and service was ok. The taste  of the pizza was fine. However, the crust was burnt and black."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"2 adults & 3 kids (11 yo, 11 yo & 14 yo) found delicious food for themselves in the middle of Vietnam!!!💯 Brilliant ✨ service, amazing 🤯 Italian food, and tasty 😋 drinks. Originally we are from Krakow, Poland where Italian cuisine is strong. We also visited Italy multiple times, and check for yourself how good this place is 👌 and just to note it: good English."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Ordered their salmon pasta & house wine and I’m impressed!
The food’s super proper - they can cook the salmon perfectly so it’s not overcooked.

The ambience is really nice - i recommend you sit on the 2nd floor which have a warm lighting decoration and is outdoor.

The price also great for such dish, i spent less than USD 10 for my pasta & wine.

Heard the pizza’s also legit - will come back to try it for sure!"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"My mum never finishes her food even if it's good and we would usually do a takeaway. Today marks a monumental moment, the food was excellent and the staffs were lovely! 💖🌿"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Squid ink pasta with salmon was nice and light.

Pizza crust was great and light, however the sauce and toppings could be improved on

Overall, great restaurant to be at when in Vung Tau. Would be back again for sure."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"The Pizza surprisingly tasts like in Italy! The pizza crust is thin like in italy, not american style! We were surprised how fast the food was served! Because of the excellent pizza we went for dessert and were astonished how delicious both Tiramisu and Choco Mousse was! Luca is an great place to escape asian food once you are tired😉"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Incredible proper Italian food in a place you'd least expect it. Service was great, didn't catch his name but the Italian server who greeted us and served our drinks was brilliant. Would go again. Reasonably priced for the level of service and quality of a western restaurant."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"This Italian restaurant really has some amazing pizzas, the ingredients are fresh, the pizzas are a decent size and is accompanied by a crunchy, flavorful base, giving that authentic Italian feel. The prices are also very reasonable  , both the food and cocktails! I definitely recommend!"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Luca's is still the best pizza in Vung Tau, bar none. However, service is still a bit slow and although the atmosphere is convivial it was a bit noisy with several tables of families with small kids."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"I popped in this evening after a walk by the sea. I had the grilled vegetables with olive oil and herbs (ate it without taking pics) which were cooked perfectly. It was carrots, courgette (zucchini), aubergine (eggplant) tomatoes and onion. Was great. I followed it with the spinach ravioli with creamy ham and mushroom sauce. It was the perfect ratio of sauce to pasta. I enjoyed every bite, washed down with 2 glasses of white wine.
Good value for money (420k all in.)
Thank you 😁"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,Very amazing friendly customer service! They speak English very good. Food so delicious! I’m impressed. Thank you🙏🏾  I highly recommend to visit this place.
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,Delicious food. The personnel is very polite and speak very good English. Will definitely visit again.
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,One of the best pizza I’ve tried in Vietnam. Perfect flavor balance and even better dough. I was pleasantly surprised.
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"The food was great!! I fell in love with the pizza with squid on it!! The combo tasted a lot better than I expected. The flavors just eked so good together! I also had the carbonara pasta, and it tasted great, too, very creamy and flavorful! The prices were nice, as well. I had a wonderful time here with my cousins!"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Authentic and perfect food, the lasagna, the Carbonara, the Caesar salad, and the spicy Diavola pizza are the best ones. Service is overall great."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Superb original Italian pizza, the dough is almost perfect, fluffy inside and well baked. They tomato sauce tastes fresh and flavorful. My only minor complaint is the cheese used, it would make everything perfect if they would use fresh mozzarella. But I understand that transport and cooling might be a problem. Also some fresh basil would be highly appreciated especially on the margherita. Nevertheless, since the dough makes the pizza certainly the best and most authentic pizza in Vung Tau. The location itself is nice too and the service very attentive and friendly. Prices are okay for the quality."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"From US, this is the best pizza we have ever had! Great service and very friendly staff! We will definitely be coming back during our visit in Vang Tau!"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"The best Italian food in town.
The service is exceptional.
Good value."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Good italan food,maybe best in Vung tau."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Great food, but even better coffee ☕️ and cakes 🍰. For me best in south Vietnam so far. ♥️
Much recommended 🙏"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Great pizza cooked the traditional Italian way.  Staff were excellent, attentive without being overbearing."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. Prices were reasonable. Will come back for more delicious food🍕
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,Love the service vibes and food. Pizza and bread basket 🧺 were great. Finally had Arugula in Asia again 🩵🌼
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Very good, decent place with reasonable prices. Though there are restaurants with better view, better interior, better furniture, maybe, this place is never a bad choice, and in fact it is the best combination of food, service and atmosphere. Because the owner values quality above all and is genuinely interested in making your experience as good as possible.
We all have different favorite food in my family but all of us - my kids, my Vietnamese husband and my mom - love this place. My son and I like lasagna, my daughter likes cavatelli tartufo, steak is great, too. Cold meat and cheese platter is good. And all of the pizzas are delicious!

As one of us had birthday that day, the owner insisted on a complimentary limoncello for both of us, it was very nice of him ! 😌"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Fresh & genuine Italian food, great pizza, very good quality-price ratio. Recommended"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"If you fancy for a proper Pizza, Luca is the place to go when you are in Vung Tau. It's probably the only place that you could try a Carbonara Pizza with eggs. Super yummy. The Tagliolini Neri Al Salmone, which is black homemade pasta (from squid ink) with salmon and cream source was absolutely the winner for me. A simple place with delicious food and friendly service. The Italian manager there is a great host."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"It's was good food and service
Just improve your taste buds with the Italian Mediterranean cuisine."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"The food was great, service excellent and all in all a great experience."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Was seated down stairs in a small air-conditioned room. Full of Mosquitoes. Moved upstairs where we had ordered our drinks waiting 30 minutes until served.  Followed by four slices of garlic bread served laying flat.on a white plate. Bizzare.! Waitress placed on opposite table from us.? Than received our pizza which was the house's special. Thinking nice N crisp.! Certainly wasn't. Half a dozen cherry tomatoes 🍅 cut in half served with some rocket, Prosciutto. Everything slid off it like a slippery dip. Nothing was cooked including the pastry base.  Than told waitresses on two occasions we would like to pay and leave waited 15 minutes. Prior to going downstairs requesting again to pay so we could leave. Owner running around perspiring 😓.  I was definitely hoping he wasn't going to be serving our food with beads of sweat dripping from him. Like he crawled out of the ocean in a wetsuit. The pizza tasted like Pita bread with salad placed on it. Sad state for the Italians if that's there best.🍕 ☹️"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Taste is delicious.
Price is reasonable.
Thank you 💐for serving good food."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,A very plaisant place with some very good foods. We have tested the raviolis with a bottle of Italian wine. A very nice evening
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,Pizza and calzone very enjoyable. Thank you for a nice dinner
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"So great italian restaurant in Vung Tau!! wine excellent, pizza wonderful, good staff ... don't hesitate !"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,Good hearty food. Friendly and attentive staff.   Nice clean and comfortable atmosphere
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,Great quality food. For someone who is a vegeterian there is decent options and tasty options available
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"We had a craving for Italian and this place was buzzing. Filled with loads of tourists! Very friendly place with welcome hellos as you enter. Service was fantastic and my husband's pizza was delicious, my spaghetti Bolognese though lacked seasoning flavour and taste really.

It is on the pricey side but the cocktails were great and we had a lovely evening sat upstairs. There is also a separate inside aircon area if you're too hot!"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,Friendly owner and staff. The owner is Italian himself. We loved loved loved the penne vodka!!! Will come back next time i’m in town
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"The food was so good we didn't even have time to take photos. The service is quite fast and pizza was delicious. The staff is very friendly. If you ever happen to be in Vung Tau, give this place a try!"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"The pizza is really tasty and the dough is the best I've ever had eaten 🤌
For my family the large pizza was more like a regular size(Comparing to Pizza David). Overall, we enjoyed it for lunch, our complements for the chefs👏❣️"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,Every dish was delicious 👍 that's the best pizza ever
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,good
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,Goid food and great service. Saporro beer notgood
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"My favourite eatery in Vung Tau. Whenever I visit I want to eat there. This time it was raining so I could not come but luckily  had the opportunity to order via Whatsapp message. I did it again enxt day.  As before, I got prompt and friendly communication in good English. Young lady brought my vegan pizza to my hotel in 20 minutes.  As always it was well made and price was very reasonable. Thank you!  Good pizaa and excellent service with a smile is so nice to get in Vietnam.   Thank you so much you professional, lovely people!"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,Great service  & pizza. One of the best I've had in Vietnam.
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,I'm from South Africa and I only eat food from Luca when I visit Vietnam.  The lasagne is absolutely delicious
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Their pizzas were amazing and the prices are reasonable. We were 60 people, who walked in unannounced and they tackled the situation greatly. Few people had to wait a while but that seems fair taking the circumstances into consideration. Overall a great experience. Highly recommend."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Absolutely fine to dine out. Open air with a rooftop, good English speaking staff."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,One of the best pizza places in Vung Tau no doubt.
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"The pizza, pasta, and salads were great.  The steak was good too, but they don’t have steak sauce that I am used to with my steak.  The steak was a little bland without a good sauce."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,Sophia was our waiter and it was like I sit not in vung tau vietnam! I sit in Italia with the brusceta that is very good and the pasta arabiata not from this world it was super delicious and wherever I get the offer italien food I would forever coming here back to luca!! Thanks to the chef that cook so good !!! Always recommend!!!
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Italian restaurant with very complete menu including pizza. The food was good, and wine excellent. I most appreciated the friendly, attentive, and competent staff, and the elegant, comfortable spaces downstairs and up. I plan to come again."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,I had very delicious ravioli here. Very nice Italian food ❤️
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"After desperate attempts at Vietnamese so-called ""pizza"" restaurants, where you only get inedible, sweet mush made of dough with loads of corn and peas, we tried this place after a recommendation. And voila: the Italian owner actually makes an ""Italian pizza"" that really deserves its name. Just like you know and are used to in Europe. Clearly recommended!"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Easily the best restaurant in the area! Clean, nice climate and atmosphere...I relax the moment I sit down. The staff are not only polite and helpful but are warm and welcoming and always smiling. Here you’ll find Italian food at its best! For example, Pizza. This being my favorite food, I try it everywhere I go. I’ve been in 49 USA states, 18 countries and everywhere I go I try the pizza. The pizza here is my #1 favorite of ALL that Ive tried...#2 is from La Grillardière in Maroc. Last but not least, the beer. Ice cold Frosty mugs filled with San Miguel; it just doesnt get any better than this. This is easily a 5 star food, service and overall dining experience. Im on my way there now..."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Really good pizza! Great dough and delicious toppings. Salads are fresh too. Pasta is good but if you’re deciding between the two, I’d go for pizza!"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,We came for dinner after reading all the great reviews and I must say it did not disappoint one bit. The place is having a truly Italian vibes and definitely the best pizza we've had so far in Vietnam. The pizza was on par with some of the pizza we've had in London and Italy so you know the quality is great. The service was excellent! Everyone was so nice and attentive. I cannot recommend this place enough.
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Everything about this place was lovely.  The people taking your order are just as sweet and kind as you can be.  The pizza is great.  I ordered a large and the cook came out, pulled out a fresh ball of dough, flattened it and cooked it right there for me.  It was I think the best pizza I've had in Vietnam.  The dough is done right.  It's fluffy and light but not soggy (the sauce is great and it's reduced enough that it doesn't get the dough soggy).  And if you're wondering why in the world would I not eat Vietnamese food or seafood (which I know is obviously the best choice) but I have 2 kids that only eat 4 things, 3 of which you can't find in Vietnam.  Pizza is it.  The price is good and the dining area is clean and very upbeat.  They also deliver to the nearby hotels but you really want to go by and say hi to the people that work there.  Except the chef.  He was the one person that I talked to there that seemed like he'd just come from a blackout drunk party.  But he can cook so I'll give him a pass."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Genuine Italien food, chef must have been living in Italy. Ingredients are of very high quality.
Very friendly staff! Great outdoor 1st floor seating."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Great Food, Great Service, Great Location
Craving a Great Pizza & A bottle of wine look no further

Couldn't help ourselves went back a second time during our stay at Vung Tau and again was not disappointed, got the same Great Food, Great Service."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,Very nice the food yummy and very quick for serve
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"This is the second time I'm writing a review for this restaurant because I'm so impressed!
This eatery serves up tasty pizza with good service, friendly staff, a welcoming atmosphere, and reasonable prices. The pizza crust is a standout—I haven't had one this good in a while. Definitely worth a visit!"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Best restaurant in Vung Tau, service is impeccable, the pizzas are easily the tastiest/best quality I have tasted worldwide. If you are staying in Vung Tau you must come here for pizza they are outstanding and very well priced. Do not miss it if in the area. The service manager speak good english and is the nicest guy. Come here if on your travels you will not be disappointed."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"I great restaurant on the road that leads to the beach. I enjoyed the Margherita pizza, atmosphere and service."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Great pizza. They seem to follow the correct recipes and preparation procedures. Everything is tasty. Definitely recommended.

But the air conditioning barely works. I was covered in sweat after just 30 minutes there. The price is also quite high."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"We came here 2 days in row.
First day we ordered salmon pasta and bechamel sauce pizza.
Pasta was great, salmon was fresh and soft. Bechamel Pizza was a little bit bland, wish ham was a bit more salty.
Second day we ordered tuna pizza and risotto.
Tuna brought more flavor on pizza and was good. However risotto was underwhelming.
Staff seem well trained and friendly.
Overall it was a good place."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"We've eaten at Ristorante Luca several times, both for lunch and dinner.

Very good food, excellent service, and excellent prices.

Authentic Italian food.

I highly recommend this restaurant."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"For my taste, food quality weren’t matched with the prices. Could have been better. Tiramisu was the worst dish, too sweet, soft (not sure that they used ladyfingers, but if they do then it’s consistency was too strange), pasta was okay."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Amazing food taste, I didn’t expect how good it is. My family was enjoyed it a lot. Service is good too. You guy can find a delicious italian food at Luca. 100% recommended."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Excepting pizza, the food is perfectly cooked according to my taste 👅 The pizza’s crust is a little bit dry so I am not really into it. The price is neutrally appropriate, not expensive as I expect for that such atmosphere and the meal I ordered.

The server is so friendly and so do the boss. The space is airy and the location is easy to find, which is suitable for having a freaking chilling dinner eating and chatting with buddies or family. Recommending every guests to come!!!!"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"The pizza is good, but other parts of the menu are weak. I’d recommend just ordering pizza and drinks. Don’t order the stir-fried chicken with lemongrass. It came out drenched in oil and was terrible. Focus on the good stuff."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Great place, highly recommended. I went here twice, which I very, very rarely do when traveling.
It's a nice location, with outdoor rooftop terrace seating and indoor ac space. The staff, including the boss/owner (?) are very friendly and competent.
The food is delicious: I had chicken with cheese and ham on my first visit and a pizza the second time. The pizza had a nice thin crust, generous toppings and was yummy! They have nice appetizers, desserts and a reasonably priced wine list as well! And you can pay by card, too."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"We love the food and ate here many times during our stay. It never disappoints and is very affordable! If you want to eat proper Italian food, look no further! We will come back next year."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Coming from New York, I was in search of a good standard pepperoni pizza, it was very delicious and definitely similar to pizza back home. It was also spicy which I enjoyed. Worth the $6 for sure. I would like to try the lasagna next time :) I knew the food and service was going to be good when the worker was singing along to the music playing in the background 🤣"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Discovered this place on the second last day in Vietnam and wish we’d discovered this sooner. So far we’ve had Italian at multiple places and this was by far the best, in terms of service, taste and pricing. Their pizza was even better than what we had at 4Ps in Ho Chi Minh City. The Desserts and cocktails were outstanding too. Highly, highly recommend this place."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Pizza was very good, I was not so impressed with the seafood fried rice. We needed to ask for soy sauce, it was not given automatically. In general a good experience"
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Pizza smells great, the crust was crunchy and the dough was thin. Nice place to have Pizza."
ChIJU7QQNdFldTERLHaVMg_hL7Y,"Very good Pizzas! Gor surprised with the taste of 4 cheeses and Margherita, probably the best 🍕 I tried in Vung Tau.
The restaurant is right next to the lake which is very chilly in the evening. Plenty of foreigners have dinner here."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"First time to dine at the Alex, great service backed up with superb foods and flavours. A bit of a hidden location of Leloi but well worth it. My wife and I shared the borsch soup, cabbage rolls and the salmon potatoe pancakes all were outstanding. In all a wonderfull experience!"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"It is a very unique Russian restaurant in Vung Tau, all the food we got was great"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Truly amazing all around. We weren’t super familiar with Russian food being from California and this was sooo good.

Great service, the waiter was lovely and very proud of the food so he helped us pick a great meal.

The hashbrowns were next-level - so crispy and flavorful (we got the mush room and cheese). The Borsch was fantastic (the waiter taught us how to have with a shot of vodka to cleanse the palette - delightful). The chicken was perfectly cooked (and we are picky because so often skewers are dry and not good).

As a bonus, the music selection was great, very cool and hip decor.

5 stars, would recommend!"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"It was a quiet Saturday afternoon. We arrived after 130pm to eat so there wasn’t too many other people. The service was professional and attentive, the place was as casual as it gets but not uncomfortable. The menu was just wide enough for a spot like this. We had the hash brown and skewers, both were really delicious. We enjoyed ourselves. Definitely looking forward to coming back again."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"wow this is the best russian restaurant i have ever been to! tastes like at home. prices are cheap and the portions are super big!!! the waiter even spoke Russian
i wish i could eat here every day but i live in hcm"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Such a gem of a Russian restaurant in Vũng Tàu! The skumbria with potatoes is absolutely delicious perfectly marinated and full of flavor. The chicken kabobs were also amazing: juicy, tender, and grilled just right. I miss home and home food so this restaurant is just a perfect solution for those extra hard days of nostalgia!"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Russia food? Come on, this is absolutely tasty and healthy, good atmosphere, good music, buckwheat stew is so good with chicken, highly recommended 🥳"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Good restaurant if you want to eat Russian cuisine)
Good and cute staff 👌"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Incredible food. The pork schnitzel and stuffed pepper were fantastic. Service was a bit slow, but understandable due to the holiday and how busy it was. Comfortable atmosphere, although very outdated. Seems quite popular among foreigners. Prices were reasonable.

However, even though I enjoyed the food, after reading the review from an employee there, I don't think I will be returning."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,Delicious Russian food for a reasonable price. Kind staff members and great service.
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"I want to leave a review about this cafe after working there for some time, I can’t call it a restaurant and there are several reasons for this. the first and most important thing is food. If you can somehow close your eyes to the cleaning staff preparing food (although it looks very creepy), it’s difficult to close your eyes to rat droppings in spices. Of course, the cuisine in this cafe is rich and varied, but the preparation of this food leaves much to be desired. The only thing I can recommend is BBQ, because it’s not cooked in the kitchen, but on a grill outside, that’s what I can recommend taking there. Also, prepare to meet the two-faced management of this restaurant, who will hate you fiercely if you order delivery for less than 200k dong. What struck me more was when the good chefs left and, unfortunately, no new chefs came, then one of the managers began to cook alone in the kitchen, for this, of course, you can respect a person, he cooks alone, etc., but for about a week and a half this man was very sick and after preparing the food, she went out into the hall, smoked, talked to everyone and said that she was very sick and was cooking alone in the kitchen, after such words, as a guest, I would not come to this restaurant at all. The atmosphere in this cafe is in the style of the 90s, where it seems to me that the management of the cafe is from. I would highly not recommend this cafe, only if for delivery, I would not want to eat in the cafe itself, only if you order BBQ. I will continue my review if management somehow threatens me after this review, but I think a couple of such notes are enough for now to understand the integrity of this cafe. The rating for this cafe is 1/5, one only because You can't give zero stars here. good luck everyone and bon appetit!)"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Takeaway food was delicious! Big portions, high quality ingredients, good quality meat and ingredients! This would be my go to restaurant"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"- The food is good but in small portions. I had to order two main dishes for a meal
- Service was very slow. The cooks really took their time in the kitchen and let us wait for half an hour for our food. They served people who came later before the early coming customers.
- You should point at the menu when you order because they only speak russian.
- Handmade drinks are mediocre. They don't have typical russian drinks."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Great food. I mean really good food. A bit slow service. Not beachfront location 😅 Go there for the food, you won't regret it."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"The best food in the town! We ate a lot there cause everything was so tasty. I had a sense that I’m back to Russia after the first meal -beef stroganoff (advice - it’s better to order for this dish some black bread because beef stroganoff has amazing sauce). Also the atmosphere is nice, very friendly staff working there. The waiter Michael was very friendly and helpful. We ordered beef stroganoff, pasta carbonara, chicken in sauce with fried potatoes, salad woth fish (seledka pod shuboi), homemade alcohol and tea. Everything was great! Highly recommend, we’ll definitely come back"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Fantastic food, great drinks, lovely place, friendly owner and staff. Try his special vodkas. Definitely worth a visit."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Nice place to have a meal in Vung Tau. If you like European cousins (Russian or Ukrainian) this place you definitely should visit. Very delicious 😋, portions are very large, reasonable prices. Very friendly staff. Michael, you are awesome 👌👍👍"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Nice place, great food, huge portions, attentive stuff. The only thing I didn't like smoking people, smoking should not be allowed inside the restaurants."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"The food here is very good , went there twice had the beet soups both times it was excellent. And the cottage cheese  strawberry dumplings, they were excellent as well, well worth trying."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Must Visit!
Big portions , cheap price and incredibly delicious"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,The food is good and the portions are really generous. The staff is also very friendly. One of the best Russian restaurants in Vietnam.
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Lovely Russian place, was happy to eat home food we're used to. Nice owners, great waiter Mikhail. The food is very delicious and the portions are quite big."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,amazing russian cuisine experience
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Authentic, homelike food. Huge selection of food. Must try fulfilling Crepes. Tasty food and amazing fast service. I like music selection as well."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Excellent, high quality, delicious foods.
Friendly  English speaking staff.
Clean cozy atmosphere.
Good prices."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"The food was okay, not bad at all. But my friend got sick from it and were half of the night on the toilet. The Service was still great."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Beautiful place, nice food, wonderful people 😊 recommend to anyone 😄 by the way, the best place for barbecue in Vung Tau!"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,Great food highly recommend
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,The food tasted so good. I love beverage too.
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"delicious, eaten many times"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,Very tasty food!
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Delicious russian cousine in a cozy environment, reasonably priced. 5 stars ❤️"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,Great place with amazing food and atmosphere.
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Just love the place.
Very good food"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Very friendly, great atmosphere, and yummy pizzas."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,Certainly best food in Vung tau!
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,Good food and good restaurant!
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,Nice place with a good food and nice music
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,Amazing good job
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,Delicious food for reasonable price
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"I had a great dinner at Alex. The Vietnamese staff was cheerful and gave enthusiastic advice, and the Russian owner was also very friendly. The food was delicious, especially the sour cream salmon crepe which was surprisingly delicious, and the thickly sliced ​​but juicy grilled meat which was very delicious. The salad was also fatty enough not to be greasy. The mushroom soup was quite rich and fatty. 2 people ordered 3 dishes and it was enough to be full. If I have the opportunity to go to VT, I will come back to the restaurant many more times."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Russian Alex here. Of well over a dozen inspected Russian restaurants all over Southeast Asia, this is the best one, and by far.   REAL Russian chef and cooks!

The food is good, some dishes are excellent. The prices are very nice - surprisingly nice for the size of the portions. Having experienced many Russian restaurants in SEA countries, I expected the portions to be very small for the indicated price - I ordered way too many dishes for 2 people, we almost exploded. Don't repeat my mistake. Every single dish here is enough to get filled.

Personal recommendations: Pork Shashlyk, Pork Zraza (it's giant!!), Solyanka was OK.

Very friendly staff.

Highly recommended for checking this place out!

🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺

Gentlemen, the music in the establishment is terrible. The food felt like a lump in my throat from some of the songs. I understand that nostalgia and homesickness manifest differently in everyone, but think about your guests. After all, you can turn on something modern and good, fortunately there is a lot of that now, and not ""good radio"". All my nostalgia and melancholy evaporated from your music.

And the swearing that regularly came from the kitchen also hit my ears.

The waiter was wonderful!

Thank you for the dinner, everything was delicious!"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Cozy space, open space with fans, mostly foreign guests (Russian-speaking). Food comes out quickly, tastes good, drinks are delicious (in the picture is Sangria), the staff is friendly and cute. I will come back and introduce to many others."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"The food is delicious. The prices on the menu look a bit high compared to the average local dishes, but the amount of food is a lot, I think it's suitable for foreigners' appetite (there are quite a lot of Russians). I ordered 3 dishes, the total bill was 350k for 2 people, but I was so full that I had to take some home 🥲 The taste is pleasant, only the sour sauce/cheese sauce can be a bit difficult for the elderly to eat, but young people can do it freely hehe. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The speed of serving dishes is fast (I went around 2pm) and the food is hot and freshly cooked. The restaurant space is spacious and airy. Quiet and only has Russian music 🫶🏻"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"We tried kvass, syrniki, solyanka, pancakes with red fish and sandwiches with sprats - everything was delicious and well prepared."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Everyone, please pay attention to the portion size here, because it is MUCH more shocking than the price. The way of eating in Saigon, but when I came here, I ordered 5 people to eat at once and I almost suffocated. If only the restaurant had advised on the portion size earlier, there wouldn't have been a scene of 5 people ordering 8 main dishes and being so full. The food is really delicious, the first time I tried Russian food and I loved it!"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"We had okroshka, shish kebab, cheesecakes, julienne pancake - everything was very tasty! You'll lick your fingers) The service is great too!
I don’t recommend pancakes with cheese and ham, the ham is terrible ("
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"It's wonderful that we have our own ALEX restaurant in Vung Tau!
And it's great that they deliver their delicious dishes!
The wings are finger-licking good, the Caesar salad with crevitas is a culinary orgasm!!

A huge thank you to you, our breadwinners!!!"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"The food is delicious. The interior of the establishment is a la 2010 (Vietnamese style for some reason, although the cuisine is predominantly European). I asked for a glass of water, but there is only paid water. The owner was rude and sent me away. The owner responds rudely to any complaint. This is definitely not a restaurant, just an ordinary eatery with exorbitant prices. There is something to compare it to. I do not recommend it."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"If we're going to have a good time, let's have a good time!
Well, where else but in a Russian restaurant can we have a feast for the stomach!!)
Caesar with chicken, pancakes, Brownie for dessert...
And there were also giant potato pancakes with salmon - a flight to the highest levels of pleasure!!!"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,I recommend Alex for dinner with family and friends if you miss Russian cuisine 😎👍
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Super!!! The portions are huge and everything is very tasty. Real Russian cuisine. We ordered three dishes for two: Olivier, pelmeni and cheburek. We ate until we were full. The portions are 300 or 400 grams. We wanted to try half the menu."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Amazingly delicious and cheap food. Highly recommend pickled vegetables, grilled meat skewers, salmon pancakes, dumplings, and soup. The staff are also cute and enthusiastic. Beautiful space, 10/10"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"I highly recommend visiting this establishment. Friendly staff, very tasty food. I especially recommend trying the ""zraza stuffed with cheese"""
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"If you sell syrniki for 600 rubles, have the conscience to at least fry them properly, and not put burnt syrniki in the order. Everyone makes mistakes, but in normal places they will remake the dish and will not put burnt syrniki in the order
I didn't like the taste either"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Great place!!! Delicious food, large portions – great value for money!
They immediately changed my wrong order, and they accommodated my drink requests. 10/10"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"We've ordered takeout several times. Everything is always delicious! Delivery is on time. Great prices and large portions! My sister recommended this restaurant; she often orders delivery for the whole family. I especially recommend trying the julienne pancakes, bacon-wrapped chicken livers, tender salmon salad, pork shashlik, and tom yum soup!🔥"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"The beetroot salad I ate was quite delicious - a harmonious combination of sweet and salty. The fried pork is also quite greasy. The last dish is a pancake with a slightly runny sauce (I guess yogurt), and the meat filling is a bit salty compared to the shell. The price is quite cheap for a meal.  High ceiling, large space"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Excellent Russian cuisine with huge portions, a great waiter greeted us with a pleasant compliment. Cheese croutons and pancakes were very tasty. I recommend! 😉"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Solyanka is excellent
Fried potatoes 🔥🔥
Dumplings are delicious, just like mom's. Service is excellent."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"A wonderful cafe with Russian cuisine, large portions, fantastically tasty shish kebab, but the interior is long outdated, it’s time to renovate, give the cooks a chef’s jacket and it will look decent, the appearance of the cooks now does not inspire confidence, stretched home T-shirts look a little homeless."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"This is an authentic Russian restaurant.
It's an open-air restaurant, so it might be best to avoid it on hot days.
All the dishes are hearty and not bad in taste. I don't know the real taste, so I can't say if it's Russian cuisine or not.
The salmon crepe was especially delicious. The spare ribs were a little less sweet than others and a little dry, but I personally liked the taste. There are several restaurants in Vung Tau that serve borsch, but this is my favorite.
The prices are reasonable, so you can easily try a variety of dishes.
The service is not very polite, but you can feel the kindness.
Liqueurs such as whiskey are also cheap, so it might be a good opportunity to drink alcohol."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Truly Russian, everyone! Anyone who wants to try Russian cuisine should come here. The menu is diverse, the portions are large. Everyone should try the soups, beetroot salad, sweet or savory pancakes and grilled meat skewers."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,The waiter was very friendly. The food was delicious and the restaurant was clean.
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"We ordered 4 typical Russian dishes: very delicious, strange and many….
Russian chef, processing, spices... completely Russian
Good price; Delicious quality;
Friendly, enthusiastic and cheerful staff. Detailed instructions for guests"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,Excellent Russian cuisine. Russian cooks. All dishes are very large and tasty. I recommend.
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Xin Chao, let's give it a rating! The hamburger 🍔 3.0. The meat wasn't smelly, and the bun was passable for Vung Tau. It's head and shoulders above the other restaurants."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Yesterday I was in this establishment.

Very tasty shashlik and solyanka, the staff works quickly and politely. I got great pleasure from visiting this establishment.

And I saw with what love the owner (she is Russian) manages the staff and wants to help and so that each client is well-fed and happy. This is worth a lot. Where both taste and attitude are at the highest level.

I rarely leave comments and reviews.
But here I decided and will say, addressing the owner of the establishment:

""Dear owner of this establishment. Unfortunately, I do not know your name. You are a sorceress and a caring manager. Your clients will always be with you, do not worry about anything. Your love for clients and staff is felt. And from this there will be even more people and clients. I have not seen this for a long time. I can say for sure that you are a sorceress from God and a fairy of the culinary craft. Thank you.""

If I could give 100 points, I would give 150.

Thank you. Sincerely, Vyacheslav Vedernikov."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Excellent cozy restaurant of Russian cuisine. The food is excellent, the portions are good, the price is decent. We have been with the family many times - we liked everything very much."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,Great crispy cheburek and kvass.
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Russian food restaurant cooked by Russians. The owner is a very cute Russian family.
The food has a real Russian flavor (I studied in Russia for 5 years so I know), the menu is diverse, and the dishes don't take too long to come out.
You should try it everyone"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Excellent restaurant!!! I am delighted! They even have things that are not on the menu)), as long as the customer is happy! Excellent steaks, tea with pancakes and various toppings..."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"I ordered Caesar with salmon, dumplings and pancakes at Alex @ALEXRestaurant - the food is simply cosmos. Very tasty, large portions, nice place. I also took delivery - quickly, the portions were just as big and tasty. Thank you very much 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,Great place! The last negative reviews were due to conflicts of interest. Ivan Agapov previously worked at this restaurant! And he did a pretty low thing by writing such reviews.
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"The staff speaks Russian. We ordered delicious pelmeni, sandwiches with sprats and buckwheat with liver (where else in a restaurant can you order a buckwheat dish)? A very good place, made with love."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,nice interior and very tasty food 😌
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Excellent restaurant of Russian cuisine! Very tasty, huge portions, reasonable prices. Exceptionally friendly and hospitable staff. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and will definitely come back again!"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Great for all those who are used to eating delicious soups and European cuisine, this is the place for you."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Very tasty traditional European food, large portions, own ingredients for dishes, no semi-finished products! I highly recommend borscht and potato pancakes with sour cream!!!"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Good attentive service, clean and airy space, reasonable price"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,This is an island of Russian cuisine in Vietnam. Very tasty and huge portions - be careful when ordering)))
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,The new menu is cool
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,I liked everything sooooo much and the food was awesome😍
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Everything is very tasty, there are even dumplings"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Delicious food, the waiter is very sociable but unobtrusive, kvass is a pushka"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,Delicious! We always order shashlik and salads.
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,Delicious :)
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"If it's Russian food, you shouldn't eat at this restaurant."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Nice restaurant interior, attentive service and simply huge portions👍"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"The food is delicious, the portions are large."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"A warm place, great cuisine. I'll definitely come again)"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,New favorite place in Vung Tau ❤️
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,Warm! Soulful! Delicious!
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,delicious
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,This place sells Russian food.
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,Wonderful place! Delicious food☺️
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Delicious food, warm-hearted hosts❤️"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"Very good place, I recommend it."
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"First time to dine at the Alex, great service backed up with superb foods and flavours. A bit of a hidden location of Leloi but well worth it. My wife and I shared the borsch soup, cabbage rolls and the salmon potatoe pancakes all were outstanding. In all a wonderfull experience!"
ChIJT8qaNdNvdTER4ZiON2VotFU,"It is a very unique Russian restaurant in Vung Tau, all the food we got was great"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Amazing place for the good steak and cocktails. You can spend here hours enjoying your time. Also got cheese plate. It was very good quality.
Totally recommended and very friendly!"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"It was a mix of feelings, much like the place itself. Was it French, Spanish, or American? The menu featured seafood paella, burgers, American-style décor, and even duck confit. The beef patty was cooked to the wrong temperature, and when we sent it back, the buns were simply re-toasted instead of preparing a fresh burger. From a decent restaurant, I would have expected a properly cooked, brand-new burger instead.
The service staff was good, 5 stars , but the kitchen hands had much room for improvement.

*. I requested a medium-cooked patty, but it arrived closer to medium-rare, with blood oozing out and soaking the patty. When I sent it back to be corrected, it returned overcooked, with hardened buns."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"After more than 2 years I returned to my once favourite restaurant in Vung Tau ... and it's even better! New central location, with a great atmosphere, complimented by excellent food at absurdly reasonable prices. Local tip, finish your meal off with a glass of Cupito!
I gave four stars on the food as my Chicken Cordon Bleu was a little overdone, but mussels from NZ in cream sauce were heavenly as an appetiser."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"A nice western restaurants with seemingly many foreign regulars. The waiter is professional and the service is great so that it feels like a fine restaurant. I came in thinking about getting their pasta, but the waiter told me their main thing is the fish and meat, so I changed my mind and got pan fried sea bass. They have today’s special menu, so I picked one from there as well. I have had better sea bass dish in this country, but the portion is pretty big here, so I think it’s a good value. The ravioli had foie gras in it and that was pretty good, but their cheese cake is like a hard cheese cake that makes you thirsty, so that was not really my thing. The main chef here is French and this is a pretty nice good western restaurant overall."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"The food and wine was good. The amount for the price is small, and it was a bit undercooked. We made a reservation ahead of time, but the staff weren't prepared at all when we arrived. Service was extremely slow. I understand that Sunday can be busy, but it should be something that the restaurant is prepared for. Other customers ordered after us and received food before us, so it's possible that our order was originally forgotten. Overall, for the price, there are better options available."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Went for afternoon lunch with my family. Very good service. Our waitress was fast and very attentive.
The food was magnificent.  We ordered from across the menu to get the maximum flavour profile. The portions were very generous and the flavours were spot on.
Thank you, a lovely experience."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"The food was the damn good. European style. Absolutely delicious! The service wasn't perfect, but wasn't bad either. The atmosphere ain’t bad. Wait till after sundown and get a table upstairs….very nice. Given what they had to work with, I don't think I could offer any suggestions to improve the atmosphere. The kitchen appeared the most professional kitchen I've seen in Vietnam. There were 4 or so 'Chef's', and they were using a variety of pots/ bowls will preparing orders. Also stove tops and oven. It sure appeared to me that detail was of great priority. The dish presentation was flawless. AND EVER DISH WAS SERVED AT THE SAME TIME. Scattered dish arrival is so common in Vietnam, and this restaurant allowed the whole table to enjoy a fabulous meal together. We had a party of 4 and every thing set on table was enjoyed, nothing left, and no hunger after the meal....decent portion size! I'm planning another trip to this city for the expressed desire to eat there again.
And I have returned. Took a ferry from HCMC for the expressed desire for another meal. LOVED it. Worth it. I do not hesitate to recommend this joint. Have dinner here, I doubt you’ll be disappointed.
Plan on leaving a tip here."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,This is the 3rd time we've been here and each time we have left super happy. The food and service is fantastic. Big up to our waitress who not only remembered us but was also super attentive. The owner is kind and generous. The price is absolutely correct for the quality and we are really happy that this is the representation of French / Basque culture in Vietnam. Bravo 👏
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"The food was truly delicious . As a lover of French cuisine, I was slightly disappointed by the absence of a warm baguette and butter, a classic combination. While the restaurant did charge an extra 5,000 VND for butter, it was a small price to pay for such a delicious meal.

The green salad was a standout, with perfectly balanced flavors. The pork belly confit was simply divine, and the accompanying sauce elevated the dish to new heights.

The restaurant's ambiance is elegant and inviting, making it an ideal spot for a romantic dinner. The wine list and dessert menu were equally impressive. Our waiter was exceptionally attentive and provided excellent service. I'm eager to return and explore the rest of the menu."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Another good review to add to all the previous. I now understand why so many people love this place. I had a great dinner of good food, warm service, and a comfortable atmosphere. Small touches like cloth napkins can sometimes go a long way, especially if you're looking to have a more special meal. Appreciated that they have multiple options for wine by-the-glass. As a solo diner, I felt very taken care of by the staff, all of whom were friendly."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Excellent French restaurant.
Delicious food & drink.
The owner of the restaurant is from France,
The food is very authentic.
Thanks for the hospitality."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"😋😋😋 We are French and felt like home in this cozy restaurant. We felt welcomed right the way with the warm bread and butter just like in France. The French style burger and homemade fries tasted like comfort food. The duck breast (magret) and mashed pumpkin were so smooth and suave. Both duck and beef patty were cooked just like we asked. Servings were nice. We had the salted caramel buttery crepe (which is a staple in our house 🇫🇷) and the chocolate ganache crepe. I requested a change in ice cream flavor and it was even better. The entire staff and owner are super sweet and professional. There are so many interesting dishes on the menu, we can’t wait to come back. 💯💯👏👏"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"A glass of Red Wine? Is it a good place for Valentine?
A good restaurant in the city, romantic atmosphere, good service.. Don’t know why this place is not busy at all time 😄
Pork: soft, good with the sauce
Mashed potatoes: probably one of my favorite dish 👍
Just imagine of dating someone here is surely deserve a visit 🥳"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"I recently dined at DONQUIJOTE restaurant and was blown away by the delicious food and impeccable service. The warm and inviting atmosphere as soon as you step inside really sets the tone for a wonderful dining experience. The menu features a range of dishes that showcase the chef's creativity and passion for French cuisine, with something to satisfy every palate. I particularly enjoyed the perfectly cooked steak and delicate seafood dishes. Although prices were slightly higher than before, the quality of the food and service was definitely worth the investment. Overall, I highly recommend DONQUIJOTE restaurant to anyone who appreciates French cuisine and wants to indulge in a memorable dining experience."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Good restaurant with nice trained staff. The tuna tartare is amazingly fresh and red, the pasta was good and the crepe with salted butter caramel was delicious, not too sweet. They even let us try a taster of draught beer for free. Only deception is the free bread that is just average."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Really recommend for Don Quijote restaurant, I had a wonderful birthday celebration with my girl friend. Everything here is great with best service!"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,Perfect place.  Steak is one of the best in Vung Tau. Very good and gentle personal.
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"It’s the only place we as a group came to in Vietnam where we could eat and eat and eat! Food is delicious, service is fantastic, portions are perfect size. Get yourself a starter main dessert with a cocktail and you’ll wish for seconds. Superb"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"I like Vietnamese food, don't let that dilute this review. As my wife and I noted, we'd like a change of menu every now and then. This was a brilliant and welcoming visit. We booked, but it wasn't really needed. Note that the phone number on facebook is the correct one. The restaurant is spacious, clean and well dressed. Staff is welcoming, friendly and attentive. Food is very much what it promises to be; very tasty, European, chef's standards and well presented. I could've easily spend a whole evening here.
Do note that the prices reflect the exclusivity but are still very reasonable.

Thank you for making our anniversary one to remember, positively."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Good food. Good seating. The restaurant opens quite late at 11. The offerings are decent, limited but great quality. I wished they had breakfast selection.
Tried their burger, it’s nice. Service is decent. And seating  is great.
A gem in Vung Tau. Do visit"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Tan, our waitress, was amazing.
The food was super. Watch out as the ‘medium’ lamb chops were quite pink for us. Maybe just us
The layout of the tables needs attention. Especially upstairs as the atmostspbere is a bit boring
Luckily the food makes up for it"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Foreign food served in a pleasant, clean environment with English menu and service. I enjoyed the Serrano ham platter entrée and my colleague and I enjoyed our main dishes of tagliatelle and roast chicken. We also had a chicken salad and I was happy to see that there was plenty of chicken included. Desserts are also available, along with alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Although not cheap by local standards, the price was certainly reasonable for this kind of restaurant. The restaurant is not big, so service was fast and professional, and the place was very clean. At the end of our meal, a nice touch was a shot of strong liquor of the restaurant's own recipe (tasted great) and the chef was good enough to ask after the quality of our food and see us out. If in Vung Tau and after a western meal, then you should look up this place as one possible option!"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"I have visited this restaurant many times for 3 years but this time is quite disappointing because of decorating and planting of meal.

As photo, is this really your best? I've never seen this kind of decorating for pasta before in any restaurant. Makes my appetite lose enough."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Delicious!!! ❤️
I had the pork chop and veg which was absolutely divine and we also had the duck breast which was so tender and so delicious! We also had the calamari starter with an amazing sauce
The waiting time was a bit long but so so worth it!
We will definitely be back for more!"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Lovely dinning place. Really good western place. Flavourful. I have never thought to find such a place in Vung Tau. Really recommend.

I have shrimp ravioli and my husband has seabass. Absolutely delicious!"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Just had two glasses of bordeaux,  a shrimp and chorizo appetizer and the beef bourguignon with the best mash potatoes I have ever eaten.  The hospitality was tremendous and the atmosphere was extremely pleasant.  I anticipate eating many meals here in the future."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"everything is perfect, delicious food, best restaurant in Vung Tau"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,This is a really nice place to go very quiet beautiful music really nice people who take really good care of you and the food is excellent
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Overal I had a slightly disappointing experience tonight at this highly rated restaurant.

To summarise: We ordered patatas bravas for starters - potatoes not crispy & served with a very basic garlic mayo. Bread brought later, no olive oil (or butter) on tables.

Mains: I ordered rib-eye steak & asked for medium, I believe they served me the rib eye by mistake & 75% of steak was well done (very uneven cooking overall as parts were still rare). After querying steak there was a simple apology from the waitress, at the end of the meal I spoke to the manager & he showed me the 2 cuts of steak, after looking iI truly believe that I was served a striploin (well-done) by mistake. Despite this I was charged for the ribeye (I’ve prepare ribeye many times before & the steak was too thin to be this cut I think). I ordered the pepper sauce to go with it & it just tasted like gravy with peppercorns added, there was no strong pepper taste, it seemed a bit rushed. The steak tasted good but I felt let down by the whole experience especially after noone (including the owner who was informed) followed up with my complaint effectively even though I had politely raised the issue several times."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Many kind of steak are available in this restaurant. I odered each different steaks, beef and chicken are recommended. Drafted beer also good. But little bit costly."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"So the missus and I decided to give this place a go after reading quite a number of glowing reviews here, but also to take a wee break from vietnamese cuisine.

I'm not going to be brutal and harsh nor sound like an elitist a**hole, but I only want to be honest with our experience here- which was surprisingly underwhelming.

The seafood paella was lacking in flavour to the point where I had to constantly sprinkle copious amount of salt and pepper, which is rather out of character of me. The rice was soggy and the base was wet, staggeringly unusual considering that the paella is Spain's national dish, so getting this quite off is... perplexing. I'm no chef but I reckon what it really needs is perhaps more paprika, safron/sofrito and a more robust broth to elevate this dish.

Gambas was barely passable, however, what would probably help is searing the prawns beforehand. The accompanying sauce base is decentt but quite weak. The baked pieces of croutons(?) helped, but it probably needs more garlic, olive oil and paprika overall.

Finally the lamb chops. Though cooked just right at medium rare, a little more charring would've really help to lift it further. Also not sure what were the toppings on the tomato halves, but we didnt think they were necessary.

The only saving grace was the service and the complimentary home made fruity liquor. Then again it was a Monday night and it wasn't busy at all."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"We have been regular visitors of the shop and always enjoy dining experience here. Attentive service, delicious food, cozy atmosphere. Couldnt ask for more 💕"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,A gem in Vung Tau. Absolutely one of the best restaurants I visited there. Pricey but deserves a try.
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Have more beautiful salads and seperate sauces. I like duck breast because the sauce is special. So yummy. With desert menu, cream brulee is good but I like chocolate cake more
Love all ^^"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,Great place. Prices are light high but quality of food is respective. Shrimps are 180.000 mango and shrimps salad is 140.000. Big portions and awasome drinks. Nice people there))
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Nice fancy place with lots of options, Italian, Spanish, French. Salad was good, carbonara was even better. Pork belly lacked flavor and balance. Icecream made up for that."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"I came here for lunch and ordered the ravioli with a glass of the house white, followed by creme brulee and coffee. I was annoyed when they then brought me a glass of house red, after I said several times ""trắng"". The wine was okay but nothing special.  The ravioli was again okay but a bit flavourless. The creme brulee was delicious. Overall a good experience, but can I politely suggest upgrading your whisky selection to some nice single malts. Also, this is the first French restaurant I have attended where I did not receive fresh bread on the table."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,Enjoyed my food and drinks .. splendid .. staff good service and friendly with me .. got everything I wanted and more .. recommended Malbec Argentina wine ..
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,Lovely french restaurant. The John Dory was excellent and the desert also tickled us the right way. Very much recommended if you want something a bit different I'm Vung Tau.
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Excellent, international quality food at a reasonable price. Had an assortment of appies including patas bravas, shrimp and mango salad and tuna tartar. Started off with a home brewed passion fruit shooter that was delicious and finished off with some mango passion fruit cheescake. Which was to die for. Will be back soon to try the seafood paella for two before leaving Vung Tau."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"I loved my experience at this restaurant! The food was delicious, and the waitress was lovely, attentive, and professional. I highly recommend this place for great cuisine and warm service. I’ll definitely be back!"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"French owner. Spanish name !
Good selection of European favourites.
Seating upstairs is nicer."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Excellent spot for European cuisine , particularly French!
Good wine pairing and amazing crepes as dessert!"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"I only questioned the texture of bread side dish. Except that, I liked the dishes what I ordered, especially the flavor of mushroom. If I were in Vung Tau, no doubt that I would be visit here again."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,Not many vegetarian dishes. But I got something like vegetable casserole as starter (cold) and added fried mushrooms - was very good. One of rare places here to find a good dessert. Creme brulee and chocolate fondant (lava cake) was excellent.
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Best meal in our trip to Vung Tau!!!

Every dish was made with love and passion. The chief also makes wine from fruits and offered 01 free glass to every customer (5 colorful glasses in the pix). They taste amazing.

Thanks so much for letting us have a relaxing and delicious lunch."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"I had a good lunch. Price is ok, not so expensive, a bit higher than average."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Decent Western food. Hi prices for local. Spanish oriented dishes, but has other international ones as well.
Well trained service staffs."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Ate here with my Girlfriend and friend while on our trip through Vung Tau, we tried the meter of Rum which was amazing, we also each loved our dishes and the appetizers, everything we had was delicious, the bowl of olives alone would of made me want to give Don Duijote's 5 stars, but the Calimari was also amazing, I personally don't like Calimari because it's chewy and I'm not a big seafood guy but theirs was done so perfect even I as well as my girlfriend and friend enjoyed it. I will be returning and I hope they get all the business possible. By far the best meal I've had in Vung Tau, maybe even Vietnam in a whole."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Was a frequent customer but I guess not anymore, their new menu is a downgrade, more expensive, worse food. We had shrimp and mango salad (didn't notice about the passion fruit sauce), the problem with this dish is none of the ingredients work with each other, and the overly sweet sauce makes the dish even more unbearable. I would recommend the goat cheese salad instead.
Our 2nd dish was lamb bbq, before it was lamb chops, now it's a chunk of boring meat which is almost 600k, I would have ordered steak if I want that much meat. We weren't that fulfilling in the end but decided to get the bill and just left for dessert in another place. It's disappointing and sad at the same time how I used to hang out with friends here so many times.

Update after having a heart to heart talk with the store employee or manager: they gave me an apology then started making excuses then demand that I should take the review off google map 🙂 yeah nah"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"As a Vegan I ordered Patatas Bravas (fried potatoes), plate of mushrooms and sautéed vegetables, with a couple of baskets of bread. The food was insanely delicious and made a nice change from Asian cuisine. Friends there are also loving there food every time."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"High price efficiency restaurant. Good tasty and good price. Clean and calm. But table is small. So, feel uncomfortable for more than 6 people together."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,This us not the first time I came for first time was last year and now back in Vietnam for second time and of course return to Don Quijote steakhouse .. the employee even the owner are very abs very friendly and lot of foreigners came to eat there .. the food they had was one of the best .. I would recommend for anyone to go there I keep came back for 3 days straight .. but I definitely will be back when I come back again to Vietnam
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"The food was amazing, and the staff were very friendly and attentive.
I highly recommend. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"After nearly two months in Vung Tau, I have to say this is one of our favorite restaurants in town. The service is at the very top of any of the restaurants we've visited. The food menu is inventive, flavorful, and high quality. And the atmosphere is very comfortable, clean, and inviting."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Maybe the best western food restaurant in Vung Tau.
Dessert is also delicious."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Tasty food, however too little for the price. Nice and very friendly staff"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"A little gem of a restaurant, food is outstanding. I've been in VT only a few days and ate here on more than one occasion.

Everything I've eaten has been of a quality I would expect at a high end establishment.

Burger was cooked to medium perfection, the fries reminded me of the chips my Mother made.

The starter of shrimps with garlic and chorizo with bread are delicious, juicy, tasty and the bread to soak up all the flavours hmmmm.

I've also eaten the foie gras ravioli with butternut that also came with bread.

Tonight I ate the shrimp starter again and the seafood linguine was delicious.

I'm a Scotsman, there's not many things that would make my hackles rise and even the owners mistake of thinking I was English when we spoke is a sin that was quickly forgiven and forgotten.

I'll be back to sample more of this small but taste bud teasing menu."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Wonderful meals and service with a smile. Lovely ambience. Great evening
Thank you."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Good vibe,
But I don’t really feel the French cuisine, the quality is just average, the lamb and duck were dry and not juicy"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Very impressed by the food, nice atmosphere and staff too"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Good vibe, nice food, a western cuisine restaurant in Vung Tau you should try."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,the seating arrangement could be improved. but the food is consistently well-made.
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,Closest I could get to authentic French cuisine in the middle of Vungtau :) super friendly staff as well!
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,Amazing food. Hope to come here again soon.
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"It was a last minute decision to eat here, but such a good one. We sat upstairs on the patio, where 2 staff were present at all times to look after the customers. The service was fantastic, the food incredible (you must try dessert, no matter what), and the price very reasonable for what you get/quality of the food. Among other things we ordered the ceasar salad, and it was the best we've eaten in a long time. It was such a positive experience, we wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Personally I think this is the best restaurant in Vung Tau.
Nice atmosphere.
Very nice French & Spanish dishes."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"My partner and I visited this restaurant in early February of this year but did not post it until now so that I could reflect on my experience. It was a disappointing evening in so many ways, Gambo prawns starter very good apart from the potato/ croutons that were rock hard and inedible. The main was a seafood linguine that we both ordered which was packed with an abundance of fresh produce. However there was a distinct taste and smell that was not pleasant. We both could not eat it and returned both dishes explaining to the waitress our reasons. We asked for the bill to leave quickly and quietly. We were offered an alternative but did not want to continue as we had lost confidence in the venue. The bill came with no reduction whatsoever. This was followed by the (French) chef who handled the situation very badly. He was clearly affronted by our opinion of his dish and made out it was us not his freshly prepared dish that was the problem as no one had complained before. In my 60 years I have only sent back 2 previous dishes as I would rather eat and not return (I’m not a complainer) I told him I was prepared to pay the majority of the bill and left 65% of the total (only because I had no change) I stood to leave but was blocked from vacating the booth by the chef. He reluctantly moved and we left. This was not pleasant for either us or the other customers. Clearly this chef does not like criticism. Needless to say we will not return or recommend this restaurant."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Brilliant restaurant, everyone should come for great service and brilliant food"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,French food were so good. They have an excellent pumpkin cream with duck breast. But the cocktail is so so.
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Cozy place, good food, beautiful presentation!  But it's hot, the air conditioner in the hall can't cope!"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"we really enjoyed our food here. garlic butter mussels, sautéed potatoes and duck breast with pumpkin mash.. everything was tasty and well-cooked.

the staff were polite and efficient. there was a small mistake on the bill but they fixed it right away and gave us some complimentary shots. also, my girlfriend left her card at the restaurant and the staff were prompt in phoning her to let her know and then arranging a grab delivery to our next location, which was super helpful.

one area of improvement would be the ambience—i like the interior but the layout, music and dining style don’t really mesh so well. the music in particular felt out of place and overly loud.

also, they should stop advertising sapporo draft offers on every table if they don’t sell sapporo draft, so that people like me don’t end up with bottled beer they don’t want. my partner loved her cocktail though."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,The food tastes great. I recommend you try 🌟
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,Lovely place to get some western food. Came from Can Tho just to have several items from their menu. No complains. Everything was good. I even had a privilege to have my pet come in with me. Keep up with the good job guys ♥️
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Great restaurant great food great service , Nhi  was great she has super friendly and helpful"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,Fantastic steak by chef Ben and excellent service by Than!
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Cute little place, delicious food and great service. I had the chicken penne and it was yummy!!"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,A proper restaurant with a tasty menu and options. Tuna tartar was super delicious but the tuna steak was not very good. Dry and hard. It was too cold inside. Will come again to try some meat.
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,I wanted to eat escargot what i've eaten in paris but totally different. Even workers were busy to close the restaurant at 9:50 pm. It seemed like they acted to kick off the customers asap.
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,Amazing food and great service. I will come back this nice restaurant for sure.
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"My friend and I were yesterday. What can I say, the interior is great. The waiters are very nice and fast. From food we ordered 5 dishes. PORK TIRRINE - is delicious, The duck is excellent cooked, but the mushrooms, mush potatoes and goat cheese salad were terrible."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"There are four stars because the food is quite good. The menu is limited which is a good sign that they have a focus on quality.  However three simple things would have improved my experience.

Firstly it was ridiculously hot so perhaps a glass/jug of ice-cold water on the table.

Secondly I don’t mind waiting for food but why not send the breadbasket out before the meal.

Finally, seeing the owner/chef smoking in his own restaurant is really disappointing.

Would I go back? Maybe."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Been a frequent visitor for 4 years. But after changing the menu, alas, I no longer want to return. Always took salads, portions were large and excellent sauce. Now portions have been reduced by 30-40%, prices have risen. Tuna tartare is also delicious, but the portion is reduced by 50%. Too bad, it was one of the few restaurants I went to. Now, alas, my path to him is closed."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Food was amazing! The fondant was a standout, service was very punctual and the staff spoke very good English. The restaurant was very clean as well. Can’t fault it 10/10"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Great meal and service.

We ordered the duck breast which was cooked to the finest perfection, complement with the saute potatoes.

Next, beef burgundy was an excellent dish from the chef with a moist and tender cut of beef.

The wine, was not an excellent choice the food we ordered.

Overall, the food at Don Quijote has given us different surprises like how Don Quijote in his journey under Miguel's words.

We did not expect these kind of dishes came from the bistro in the corner of VT city."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"The best restaurant in Vung Tau. Great european food (meat or fish) and great presentation of the dishes. Very professional staff and a really nice environment with a high level of hygiene.

I highly recommend it"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"We only had a quick early evening meal, but the prawn and tuna salads just perfectly hit the mark for us."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Me and my friend had a lovely time. Food was amazing, dessert was amazing and the person taking care of us (Nelly) was lovely to chat to, also very attentive and light-hearted. Thanks to Donquijote for doing everything right —a lovely experience."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Must have when you are in Vung Tau. The seafood paella is top notch, burger and creamy penne pasta wonderful.

Overall a lovely experience dining here."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,I had a good afternoon at Don Quijote. People were very  friendly and the dishes were quite nice
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Food ok, however french fries where  terrible, i could not eat it. Beer from the tap and service was very good."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Loved everything we had at Don Quijote's so much we had to return (and if we had stayed in Vung Tau longer we would have been back multiple times). The menu isn't extensive, but each item is done to perfection. The owner is very nice and dedicated to providing great meals. We'll definitely be back."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,The food was delicious. We tried seafood paella - yum! Lamb chops were juicy! Tuna on veggies ratatouille - amazing! Even simple stewed veggies were well seasoned and tasty! Totally recommend this place!
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Awesome place, great atmosphere. great menu of southern France and northern Spain. Green mussel soup is just worth michelin star level. Meat is outstanding. Have to try for a great evening."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,Lamb chops are juicy. The food is perfect for me. They use natural day light so my food photos are too white and miss some bounce lights. Suggest to turn on interior lighting for better ambiance.
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Ate here around 8 months ago and well satisfied and put a 5 star review

Went back for dinner 23 April 2023 and extremely disappointing.  The cold plater and cheese was 250,000 VND and it was miniscule, maybe enough as a starter for a 10 year old. Very expensive. Don't mind paying for quality but this it was not."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"I came back twice in 1 day! I had seabass and prawn/mango salad, 2 desserts (creme brule & chocolate fondant) and an Old-Fashioned cocktail. Tasty food, awesome desserts and very friendly French (?) chef. Love it and will keep coming back."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,Delicious food. All the dishes we ordered were delicious. Probably the best burger I’ve had in Vietnam. The restaurant is also very clean and the staff is friendly.
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,Great place to come back anytime we visit Vung Tau
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,Exceptional customer service & great food.
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,The waitress Thanh gives an amazing service in both Vietnamese and English! Good is splendid
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,very nice food. new place have good decoration. Owner friendly
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"New, clean restaurant, but lacks atmosphere; lighting too bright, chairs not so comfy, service 'distant'.
Food is nice, tasty and a little pricy, some dishes on the menu were not available."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,Really high quality restaurant.  Fresh ingredients a wide menu with interesting well put together dishes with reasonable pricing.  The paella is a great dish to share.
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Great food, decently cheap. However, my lamb was amazingly bland, almost as if they forgot to season it. The sauce was bland as well. Other than that, it was a great experience."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"A very nice real Spanish atmosphere: Wooden (wine) barrels with high wooden bar stools, white-washed walls, pictures from Spain on the walls (San Fermín - the running of the bulls, La Giralda - The cathedral of Sevilla with its 2 towers, wind mills - the molinos of Don Quijote), wooden tables with high chairs .... I felt a bit homesick.
The menu is extensive, as well meat as fish. I had tuna salad for starters, rib-eye as second dish. The salad was really good, tuna is quite dry, normally, but not here. The rib-eye was superb. This is obviously a cook who understands cooking, and loves his profession.
Highly recommended 👍 👏👏👏."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,Hidden gem. Air conditioned. Superb food. Very reasonably priced. Excellent service.
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,bellissimo! Our food was mega
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"A fantastic dinner: the food here is delicious, great menu, all fresh and very good service.
I would highly recommend this place when you are in Vung Tau!"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,Heard good things from friends. My visit might have been outlier. Beef smelled like it was past freshness date. Service was decidedly bad. Couple warm dishes served cold.
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"I believe this is the Best in vung tau.
They also have a new menu with more variety of meals"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,You can have the perfect lamb chop
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"OMG! Soooo good like 5 star good! Pork chop,mushrooms and vegetables. Ice cold Sapporo! Everything just perfect! Best western food in all of Vietnam."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,Good food and the service is excellent
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,This is a high end French restaurant. I have no complain and food is delicious. The price is a bit high end but you get what you pay for. It just fantastic food.
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Toulouse sausages and the Tagliatelle pasta are two of my favorites. Also, the basque style chicken is good. Some like the goat cheese salad."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,Delicious duck burger and we also share the tuna steak. Proper good honest food with exciting twists. Highly recommend!!!
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Genuine French Cuisine with heavy Spanish influence. Helmed by French man Ben , one can't get more authentic than that here in Vung Tàu.  In addition prices are very reasonable for such haute cuisine"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,AMAZING FOOD!!!! One of the best I have had ever. Simple but so well done and so full of flavor. You have to come and try. I highly recommend
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Food is very good. Best western food in Vung Tau.
We come here for steak mostly.
Have some good selection of wine."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Amazing place for the good steak and cocktails. You can spend here hours enjoying your time. Also got cheese plate. It was very good quality.
Totally recommended and very friendly!"
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"It was a mix of feelings, much like the place itself. Was it French, Spanish, or American? The menu featured seafood paella, burgers, American-style décor, and even duck confit. The beef patty was cooked to the wrong temperature, and when we sent it back, the buns were simply re-toasted instead of preparing a fresh burger. From a decent restaurant, I would have expected a properly cooked, brand-new burger instead.
The service staff was good, 5 stars , but the kitchen hands had much room for improvement.

*. I requested a medium-cooked patty, but it arrived closer to medium-rare, with blood oozing out and soaking the patty. When I sent it back to be corrected, it returned overcooked, with hardened buns."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"After more than 2 years I returned to my once favourite restaurant in Vung Tau ... and it's even better! New central location, with a great atmosphere, complimented by excellent food at absurdly reasonable prices. Local tip, finish your meal off with a glass of Cupito!
I gave four stars on the food as my Chicken Cordon Bleu was a little overdone, but mussels from NZ in cream sauce were heavenly as an appetiser."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"A nice western restaurants with seemingly many foreign regulars. The waiter is professional and the service is great so that it feels like a fine restaurant. I came in thinking about getting their pasta, but the waiter told me their main thing is the fish and meat, so I changed my mind and got pan fried sea bass. They have today’s special menu, so I picked one from there as well. I have had better sea bass dish in this country, but the portion is pretty big here, so I think it’s a good value. The ravioli had foie gras in it and that was pretty good, but their cheese cake is like a hard cheese cake that makes you thirsty, so that was not really my thing. The main chef here is French and this is a pretty nice good western restaurant overall."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"The food and wine was good. The amount for the price is small, and it was a bit undercooked. We made a reservation ahead of time, but the staff weren't prepared at all when we arrived. Service was extremely slow. I understand that Sunday can be busy, but it should be something that the restaurant is prepared for. Other customers ordered after us and received food before us, so it's possible that our order was originally forgotten. Overall, for the price, there are better options available."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"Went for afternoon lunch with my family. Very good service. Our waitress was fast and very attentive.
The food was magnificent.  We ordered from across the menu to get the maximum flavour profile. The portions were very generous and the flavours were spot on.
Thank you, a lovely experience."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,"The food was the damn good. European style. Absolutely delicious! The service wasn't perfect, but wasn't bad either. The atmosphere ain’t bad. Wait till after sundown and get a table upstairs….very nice. Given what they had to work with, I don't think I could offer any suggestions to improve the atmosphere. The kitchen appeared the most professional kitchen I've seen in Vietnam. There were 4 or so 'Chef's', and they were using a variety of pots/ bowls will preparing orders. Also stove tops and oven. It sure appeared to me that detail was of great priority. The dish presentation was flawless. AND EVER DISH WAS SERVED AT THE SAME TIME. Scattered dish arrival is so common in Vietnam, and this restaurant allowed the whole table to enjoy a fabulous meal together. We had a party of 4 and every thing set on table was enjoyed, nothing left, and no hunger after the meal....decent portion size! I'm planning another trip to this city for the expressed desire to eat there again.
And I have returned. Took a ferry from HCMC for the expressed desire for another meal. LOVED it. Worth it. I do not hesitate to recommend this joint. Have dinner here, I doubt you’ll be disappointed.
Plan on leaving a tip here."
ChIJgx_cJ-5vdTERc_j46WU0ZUg,This is the 3rd time we've been here and each time we have left super happy. The food and service is fantastic. Big up to our waitress who not only remembered us but was also super attentive. The owner is kind and generous. The price is absolutely correct for the quality and we are really happy that this is the representation of French / Basque culture in Vietnam. Bravo 👏

ChIJWwSI8HlxdTERUzrpIFqq-Kk,"MID-RANGE PRICE, HIGH QUALITY

A suitable place to organize dating parties, family parties, etc. Luxurious, cozy and friendly space.

The food is delicious, with many dishes for me to choose from. My family only had 4 people, but when I chose the dishes, I found all the dishes so delicious that I had to order 6-7 dishes 😆

What impressed me was the restaurant's customer service, very nice, taking good care of customers. The toilet is clean and has air conditioning.

The restaurant's atmosphere is cheerful, I find it very similar to Sit Dat restaurant, but Tan Long Hung's concept is warmer and more luxurious.

Thank you very much Tan Long Hung, if I have the chance, I will definitely come back."
ChIJWwSI8HlxdTERUzrpIFqq-Kk,"Today I came to the restaurant to celebrate my birthday with my family, but I didn't expect the service to be so attentive.

The cheese layer was lightly burnt and crispy on the outside but still retained its richness on the inside, blending with the seafood filling underneath – juicy, fresh and rich. What impressed me most was that despite using quite a lot of cheese, the dish was not at all boring – a huge plus."

If you are looking for a nice view, airy, clean, delicious food restaurant in Rach Dua ward, this is the place. Draft beer is 12k a glass, the table is full of food, each person spends 250k. The photo was taken when we were full 😂. Trustworthy, guys."

After just one session, I noticed a big difference in how my shoulders and back felt. It’s not a luxury spa, but the results were excellent. Highly recommended!"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,Super friendly service! Food is delicious. I love the Squidcake which is very tasty. 😊 I will come back in future travel.
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,Great seafood dishes and friendly staff!
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The food is great, exceptionally good at reasonably price. However, when come at dinner time the place can get quite noisy as it is really popular and crowed. The food was forgotten by the kitchen a lot when this happen, thus can create a somewhat disappointing when eaten.

Tips: come in the afternoon for good food and service"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The food here is delicious, staff are friendly, efficient and enthusiatic. Food will be served in no time after orders are placed, which is certainly a plus point for those in a hurry, the others may feel pushed if they want to pick their own pace. If you are lucky enough, you may enjoy the scenic sea over the street, if no cars are parking between the restaurant and the sea. The restaurant may be a bit too noisy to some,  given the number of guests, but this is kind of normal for restaurants in this area during the high season.."

ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,The oysters here are super cheap and delicious. 35k for a bowl of oysters - you're right. My whole family ate until we were satisfied and spent more than 600k. The staff were enthusiastic and polite. Will definitely come back and have recommended it to friends!
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Oysters are very cheap, 50k/portion of 5.

Grouper 590k/kg, made into 2 dishes: grilled and hotpot, hotpot broth is a bit sweet.

The remaining dishes are mostly 99k/portion.
Good price, cool air conditioning, sea view. Suitable for families with babies, children.."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Minus points: food takes a long time to come, although when I went to eat, the restaurant was a bit crowded, not too crowded. It makes it easy to lose interest in eating even though the food is delicious

Plus points:
- seafood is always fresh, processed quite well. Shrimp and squid are sweet and fresh
- clean, airy, beautiful compared to other restaurants in the same area along the embankment. Toilet is quite clean"

ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The restaurant is newly opened but the service and food quality are very good, the restaurant space is spacious and clean, the dishes are served quickly, the staff is attentive, the food is reasonably priced, fresh and delicious, suitable for my family's taste. If you go to Phuoc Hai embankment, try this restaurant, it is right in the center, convenient to go near the beach. My personal feeling is very satisfied."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The restaurant cooks delicious food, fast, reasonable price, fresh seafood, seafood restaurant but clean floor, tables and chairs, clean restroom with air conditioning, overall satisfied."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Newly opened, clean restaurant, no other restaurant in the embankment area has a clean toilet like this one - has air conditioning and music. Fresh food, not cheap compared to other restaurants and Vung Tau. You should choose this restaurant if you want a clean, polite place to sit."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Rate 5 stars to support. There are 2 suggestions:
- Working in the kitchen, there is no such thing as throwing away grouper stomach
- Need a waiter to pick up ice for customers"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Clean toilet with air conditioning. Fresh food, enthusiastic service, clean and comfortable seats with sea view. Price is okay, not high, grilled oysters with scallion oil 79k/10 oysters."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The store has a spacious, airy space, especially the restrooms are extremely clean, this is a big plus for the dining experience.
About the food: seafood porridge is okay but not too special.
Highlights include steamed snails and snails with salted egg sauce - the snail meat is sweet, chewy and crispy, with rich sauce flavor, very worth trying. Steamed shrimp and salted egg shrimp are also excellent, the shrimp meat is thick, fresh, and extremely chewy to eat.
Grilled oysters with onion fat are well presented but the taste is a bit bland, not really flavorful.
Steamed crabs are a bit small, the meat is sweet but not yet eaten.
The fries and stir-fried vermicelli were okay, nothing special.
The biggest minus point is the fried beef noodles - the beef is very hard, the noodles are dry and lack sauce. The restaurant should consider breading the beef to make it softer and stir-frying it with thick sauce to make the dish more flavorful.

In short: snails and shrimp should be tried, but beef noodles should be skipped!"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The waiter was very rude. I told him it would take 10 minutes to prepare the dish, but he waited 20-25 minutes. Then the stingray hotpot came out and smelled fishy and burnt. I told the restaurant to argue, I was helpless. The tall, skinny guy's service attitude was unacceptable!"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"If you come to Phuoc Hai, you should visit this restaurant. It's clean, the staff is enthusiastic, and the price is ok. 10 points"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,The service is so bad. I sat there for almost 2 hours and only 2-3 dishes were brought out even though the restaurant wasn't very crowded. Everyone should consider carefully before entering the restaurant.
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Seafood (mainly snails, oysters ...) is simply prepared like steamed, grilled with scallion oil, cheese ... in general, it is ok to eat, dishes that require a little more skill are only average like stir-fried vermicelli with crab, vermicelli and vegetables with crab legs are separate and not sticky ...
The restaurant is right on the Phuoc Hai embankment, quite clean, sitting outside in the evening is airy and cool.
The staff is very enthusiastic and polite."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The restaurant is very crowded, the food is delicious, the price is reasonable."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"It's so delicious, you should try the striped mantis shrimp, reasonable price, good service, fresh food, delicious and fragrant porridge. I only remembered to take a picture after eating 😅"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Along the embankment, there is this clean and airy restaurant. The price may be a little higher than the surrounding area, but it is suitable for families with children and adults. 
Seafood, fresh and delicious food, and a lot of it. The whole family spent more than 1 million and was full. 
The staff is quite quick, cheerful and enthusiastic."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Delicious food, reasonable price and fast service. My family visited the restaurant twice a day. Will come back next time."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"There are many seafood restaurants on this street, but I chose this place because it's clean, airy, and spacious. It's a bit crowded on weekends, but the seafood is fresh and delicious, the prices are reasonable, and the staff is very enthusiastic right from the parking lot 👍"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The nth time I ate here. A familiar place for my family. The food is very delicious, once I stayed at Thanh Hao homestay 100 steps away from the restaurant, the room had a sea view.
This time I went with a friend who took 4 children out. So the hotel has a place to play. When I finished eating at the restaurant, I got caught in the rain and couldn't call a taxi, so the owner drove me home. We thank him very much. The people around always praise him, but today I just got to meet him.
While eating, we can watch the sea, and on a lucky day, we can also watch the rain."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,The staff is very enthusiastic. Ordering at the end of the day is not difficult at all. The food is delicious and fresh.
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Open air seating space, food is OK, served a bit cold. Staff is extremely enthusiastic, actively cleans up, super friendly. Reasonable price."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,The restaurant is clean and cool. You can sit and eat comfortably when the air outside is hot and sunny.
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The restaurant is located right at the beginning of the embankment, running down there are other restaurants, although the restaurant looks a bit fancy compared to other restaurants, I think the price is about the same as the restaurants I have eaten recently. 

Fresh seafood, most of the dishes I ordered were cooked well, however later I ordered 1 portion of steamed clams with lemongrass and 1 portion of steamed clams with Thai style, I found the steamed with lemongrass to be more delicious, the water was naturally sweet, the steamed Thai style with spices but not as good, the water was a bit brackish, not delicious. The oysters here are steamed for 35k/kg, I ordered oysters with cheese, salted egg and scallion oil, which were delicious, but the milk oysters were quite small and not very satisfying

The day I went to the restaurant, it was quite empty so the service was fast, the staff were also enthusiastic and comfortable. Our bill was more than 800k and divided by 4 was also very reasonable"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The shop is clean, the prices are reasonable, the staff are extremely enthusiastic and cute. Will recommend to friends to come to the restaurant"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The advantage is that the food comes out quickly but is very cold.
The lobster dish is the most expensive but tastes bland, the shrimp is too tough to chew, there is no sweetness, the taste is a bit difficult to eat.
The staff is enthusiastic. The hot pot is delicious. The pineapple fish is ok."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Fresh food, friendly staff. Reasonable price."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Delicious food, reasonable prices, even some dishes are very cheap, fresh steamed oysters are only 35k/kg, I ate 4kg, the anchovy salad is very delicious"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The restaurant has indoor and outdoor areas. Sitting outside is cool with a view of the night sea, but a bit dangerous because of the many cars turning around, street vendors often soliciting.
The menu has a variety of dishes. Seasoning is delicious, suitable for the taste. Cheap oysters are only 35k/1kg. My table of 5kg was tired from eating. Fresh crab, fresh tiger prawns. Fresh seafood is delicious. You should also try the fried rice because it's delicious.
The staff serves quickly, the dishes are served quickly.
Cheap prices. 8 people eat for only 2 million and you'll be full.
The toilet is super clean and cool. Add 1₫."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,Fresh and delicious food. Attentive and polite staff. Many staff are attentive to customers like the owner of the restaurant. Like
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"This June 1, my wife accidentally told me to eat at this restaurant. It's also bad luck that I didn't choose to read the review carefully but...

Parking was most impressive. The security guards who took orders were very enthusiastic, cheerful and professional

We chose to sit outside on a super cool windy evening. The location is ok and the food is equally ok, the shrimp, squid, oysters and clams are perfect. No matter where you go, delicious food is fun. Well, the inside is also spacious, beautiful and bright. In general, the price is good and the service is good

Will definitely come back."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,Delicious and attractive restaurant! Clean and cool in the bathroom when it's sunny.
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Thanh Hao seafood restaurant on Long Hai embankment. The restaurant is spacious and clean. The seafood is not delicious, but the price is reasonable. Looking at the oysters brought out makes me so bored that I don't want to eat them."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The restaurant looks cleaner than other restaurants along the embankment, and the dishes are served quite quickly. They sell by portion and by kg, and the food is fresh and swimming. The oysters are a bit small, the mantis shrimp is big but the meat is quite soft and a bit flat. The clams and squid are ok. The price is not as cheap as some people often review in VT, it is on par with SG."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,Oysters were fresh and delicious. Squid was not fresh. Asked for mai fish and got fresh fish but the sauce was bad and the vegetables were missing star fruit and green banana. Fast service. Parking available across the street.
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"My family went in a large group but the service was very quick, the seafood was fresh and delicious, the price was not too expensive. Right on the embankment, after eating we could go out to cool off, the restroom was clean and cool."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"I visited this place because of its favorable reviews while visiting Vietnam for a company workshop.
It's a clean restaurant with fresh seafood and affordable, delicious food, so I think Koreans will love it.
The staff and owner are especially helpful. They speak English well. Since our hotel was far away and Grab wasn't available, I asked if they could help me get a taxi, and they happily obliged.
They had rice paper, and they even kindly explained how to eat it to us, even though we weren't sure how to eat it.
Every dish is delicious, so if you're ever in Vung Tau, be sure to stop by."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"delicious food, enthusiastic and lovely staff, reasonable price, clean, wifi, clean and fragrant toilet (there is air conditioning in the toilet), new facilities, but I don't know why it seems quite empty, hope the restaurant tries to maintain this level!!!"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"For me the food is ok, everyone should come and enjoy the experience. It's delicious."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,Good food restaurant. Reasonable price. Lovely and enthusiastic service...
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"✓ The restaurant space is airy, near the sea.
✓ Fast and attentive service. I saw the guys cleaning the table very quickly, and it was also clean.
✓ Delicious food. Spring rolls and squid rolls, I recommend everyone to try."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"One of the most elegant seafood restaurants on Phuoc Hai embankment. The restaurant is very airy, with a cool sea view all day long, and especially does not smell of seafood. The seafood is extremely fresh and well-prepared. There are dishes from popular to high-end, with a variety of dishes. The staff is very enthusiastic and dedicated. The restaurant is often very crowded on weekends, so you need to come early to get a table."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"A restaurant worth visiting and even coming back after the first time is something that 99% of you do not need to worry about. My family and I came here for dinner and came back many times because of the following criteria:
1. The restaurant's location is beautiful, overlooking the sea and the open design with maximum sea view so that every early afternoon you can enjoy food while watching the sea view and sunset. If you say it is as beautiful as a cafe with investment, it is not, but I can rate it at 4.5/5 stars on this point.
2. Food quality: 4.5/5 stars. The food is quite fresh, diverse and well-prepared.
3. Price: 5/5 stars, very reasonable price.
4. Service quality: 4.5/5 stars, the weekends are quite crowded so we can't expect perfection, however the staff are enthusiastic, advise you on dishes, take good care of the children, and give ice cream to the children after eating, which is something that few restaurants I've seen do.

5. Hygiene: 4.5/5 stars, the restaurant has clean and beautiful restrooms and air conditioning.

I will come back here if I have the opportunity to stay in Long Hai or Ho Tram.
A seafood restaurant worth experiencing and enjoying.

#Highly recommended restaurant"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"There are many restaurants on this street, this restaurant looks brighter, more beautiful, cleaner, and the price is also cheaper, not expensive at all. 
My group of 9 people, because we had eaten seafood at the resort, when we arrived we only ate full dishes, so we only ate rice and hotpot, the cost was less than 700k, but we ate full, delicious food, and made a lot of food
The most impressive thing for me was the restaurant's restroom, it was the first time I saw a restaurant invest in air conditioning in the restroom, beautifully decorated, playing soft music, pleasant aroma, and cool slogans!! Like it! 
A wonderful experience when coming to the restaurant!"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Cheap seafood, good quality food, the restaurant is located next to the sea, nice view, the restaurant has a VIP room, a place worth experiencing when you come to Phuoc Hai 👍"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Delicious food, reasonable price, enthusiastic staff, good service. Seeing it's luxurious makes people hesitate to come in. Okay, everyone should try it."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Fresh seafood
Reasonable price
Clean and airy
OK"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"This place is polite, airy, clean. I like to eat somewhere with clean toilets so I will give it 5 stars. The food is delicious, tasty, fresh. Highly recommend everyone.."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The waiter was not very attentive. He told me the food would take a long time to arrive, and said it would only take 10 minutes, but we waited for an hour. The restaurant said they ran out of rice so they didn't dare to serve hot pot. The restaurant argued and made excuses - I give up."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Parking: OK

Interface: clean restaurant, fragrant toilet, cool air conditioning, quite safe for children

Staff: cheerful, enthusiastic

The important thing is that the food is quite good, depending on each person's taste

Price: reasonable"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The restaurant is clean, cool, the staff is cheerful and enthusiastic.
The food is served quickly and tastes good.
The price is reasonable."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The staff were absent-minded. They sat there absent-mindedly playing with their phones. The customers from the next shop backed up their cars and laughed, impolite.

The shop looked decent, but the staff were terrible."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"I went on April 30th and it was very crowded. When I arrived at 7:30, the staff decided not to accept more tables because it was too crowded, and informed that we might have to wait half an hour to an hour for the food to be served. But NO, the food was still served quite quickly and continuously. The milk oysters were plump and fatty and very delicious, so I ordered 4 portions, the salted egg snails were also very delicious. The staff, although very busy and visibly tired, were still enthusiastic, immediately provided whatever I asked for, not daring to show any displeasure. Overall, it was okay, I will come back next time."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The restaurant is okay but the food takes too long to come out. The scallops seem to be frozen. If you want to eat, order fresh seafood in front of the restaurant. The restaurant does not accept credit cards or issue red invoices."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Not your average restaurant, but the food and service are well worth it. You pay for freshness and experience – and it's worth it!"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Not only delicious but also professional. Cold towels, dipping sauce, service are all carefully taken care of. What I like most is the space - both modern and cozy. Eating feels extremely comfortable."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Have eaten here 3 times and always satisfied. Seafood is carefully selected, not fishy, ​​not frozen. Taste is just right, no overuse of spices. Airy space, beautiful decor"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Seafood food Customers ordered many dishes at once but it took a long time for one dish to be brought out. When asking the waiter, he said: we've only been here for 15 minutes, inside customers have been waiting for 25-30 minutes and it's still not here, even though the restaurant wasn't crowded at that time. Then they forgot the dishes customers ordered. When customers asked, the staff was very impolite and disrespectful. Anyone going to Phuoc Hai - Vung Tau should avoid this restaurant. Disappointing."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Went to celebrate our wedding anniversary, the staff suggested taking photos with a very nice angle. The food was also specially decorated. A very memorable memory!"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Looking at the dish, you can see the chef's heart. From the way the fish is sliced ​​to the way the vegetables are arranged, everything is meticulous. It is obvious that it is made from good ingredients."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The most spacious and airy restaurant on the embankment
Fresh food, reasonable price
Enthusiastic staff
Beautiful restaurant 🥹🥹"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,Food was small and not great but came out quickly.
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The menu is diverse, from simple dishes to high-class dishes. I especially like the combo for 2 people - enough dishes, enough flavors, not boring."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,Clean restaurant with reasonable price. 1kg oyster price from 35k VND. Sea view
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"I happened to see good reviews so I stopped by to try it out. It was really delicious. It was a bit crowded on the weekend. There were 2 of us but the service was still cheerful and enthusiastic, no attitude at all.

The food was generally quite tasty. The mai fish salad was delicious, but the portion was a bit too much for 4 people to finish, the garlic fried rice was delicious and tasty. The basic dishes were well prepared. As for the grilled cheese dishes, I didn't like them because they were too sweet. Hope to have the chance to come back next time!"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The cleanest and most impressive restaurant in Phuoc Hai embankment area. Therefore, the price is also one and a half times higher than outside. However, the quality is unquestionable. Parking is limited. Should go early."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,Nice restaurant with friendly and attentive staff. The food was a new experience and truly delicious! We highly recommend it!
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Delicious, surprisingly cheap. Our company has another wonderful summer vacation. Increase 2 here, 16 people 2 boxes, 1.8 million

ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Friendly, quick, always smiling staff. Food comes out quickly, hot and beautifully presented. A great dining experience"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Many restaurants have some good dishes and some bad dishes. But here, every dish is well-prepared and has the right taste. I especially like the seafood salad – sour and spicy, not fishy, ​​extremely delicious."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Steamed oysters for only 35k, oysters with scallion oil 79k and grilled cheese 100k, the price is the same as other restaurants. But the space is superior."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"I'm a picky person, but after eating here twice, I still can't find any negative points. Everything is perfect, from the staff to the chef."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Not only did the food arrive on time, the staff also paid attention to whether the customer liked spicy food or not, and whether they needed a cold towel – very attentive. The service attitude made the food even more delicious!"

ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Fresh food, beachfront, airy."

ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"I like the grilled style – keeping the natural sweetness of the seafood. The restaurant does it right: clams, shrimp, fish are grilled just right, not burnt, not dry. First time here and very impressed! The seafood is fresh, especially the grilled lobster and oysters. The seasoning is just right, not too salty. The staff is super enthusiastic. Will definitely come back!"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The restaurant looked clean so I tried it but was a bit disappointed. The staff was not enthusiastic, the portion was a bit small. The price is generally the most expensive of all the restaurants on the embankment
Ordered a plate of mantis shrimp for 139k and got 3 =))) while I went to the restaurants next door which were cheaper and had much larger portions."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"I have tried many places but this is my favorite. The quality of the food is consistent, from fish salad to seafood hotpot. The price is not cheap but completely worth it. The service is very professional!"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"A romantic evening with seafood, warm yellow lights. Raw oysters with wasabi. I am addicted to the steamed squid with ginger here!"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"It's not that the food isn't delicious, it's just that it takes too long to come out. It takes so long that I don't even know what I ate. There's no bill even though the restaurant is very big."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Anyone traveling to Ho Tram, remember to stop by Thanh Hao to eat seafood! Especially steamed oysters are only 35k a portion, delicious. The snail, crab, shrimp and crab dishes are all amazing. 5 stars for Thanh Hao!"

ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"I don't know what recipe the restaurant uses, but the dipping sauce is delicious, rich, and truly 'signature'. Whether it's salt, pepper, lemon, or ginger fish sauce, it's all very flavorful."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Extremely beautiful hot pot dish - arrange vegetables, fish, rice paper into flowers. Delicious and pleasing to the eye"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"We stopped by along Phuoc Hai embankment but overall the experience was okay. The restaurant is spacious, airy and clean, suitable for families. 

Steamed milk oysters 35k/kg are big, fatty and delicious. We ordered more snails to eat, which was also delicious. I don't know how the price compares to the general level of Phuoc Hai, but I think it's reasonable, not too expensive."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The restaurant has a cool view, comfortable open space, very suitable for dinner with friends."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"As a native of Central Vietnam, I really like the taste here. The seasoning, dipping sauce, and raw vegetables are all authentic to my hometown. The stir-fried squid with satay is my “best-seller”."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"No need to go to a resort or luxury hotel to have delicious seafood. This is the place to ""eat real food, real price, real quality""."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,Fresh food. Quality oysters. Would have been 5 stars if the staff hadn't forgotten the 2 hot pots that lasted 30 minutes. Air conditioning is an advantage of this area.
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The decoration has a very pleasant ocean feel. The dishes are presented delicately, the taste is suitable for both the elderly and the young. I really like the restaurant's 5-course seafood combo."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"At first I was a bit hesitant because the price was higher than average, but when the dish came out it was worth it. The crab was firm and hot when cut. The giant fresh prawns were grilled with fragrant salt and chili."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Every time I travel, I stop here for a meal. It feels like elevating my vacation. The space is as beautiful as a resort, the food is as high quality as a Michelin star restaurant."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"My mother is very picky about food but still praised the grilled fish here as delicious, not fishy, ​​and just right. The whole family was satisfied when we went to eat there – there was nothing to complain about!"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Bring your children and still feel comfortable because the restaurant has high chairs and spacious space. The service also cares about children, not making the family wait long."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"The strong point is that the staff is very ok. Even though there are many customers, the service is very ok. The food is also moderate. The toilet is clean."
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Fresh crab, firm meat. Special dipping sauce enhances the flavor. Very satisfied with everything!"
ChIJ7TSgo4d1dTERXy3DJcYUWB8,"Fried green crab with salt is extremely delicious, the meat is sweet, firm, not dry. There is also a very nutritious oyster porridge, suitable for the elderly."

After just one session, I noticed a big difference in how my shoulders and back felt. It’s not a luxury spa, but the results were excellent. Highly recommended!"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,We visited for dinner and were looking for sashimi-style dishes. The staff helped us choose the right ones. Everyone was very helpful and accommodating.
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"If you’re looking for a seafood restaurant that has delicious food with a beautiful view I definitely recommend this gem!

The seafood is as fresh as it gets, with a menu that showcases the best the ocean has to offer. Service here is just as impressive. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive without being intrusive.

I recommend the fried garlic flavour when it comes to the shrimp."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"We went to Boho restaurant for dinner. Food was delicious with also suitable non seafood options. However, service was outstanding! Huge thanks to Mr. Phuong who served us fantastically through the evening!"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,Great delicious foods with affordable price and stunning coastal sea view. Good ambient and nice service.
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Not a great place for Australians looking for food, we struggled with what we Evan ordered, but the roast chicken was ok"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,Great seafood restaurant right by the ocean. I highly recommend! Food was delicious and service was very friendly and fast. I will definitely be coming back again!

ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Five-Star Review for BOHO

I recently had the pleasure of dining at BOHO and it was truly an exceptional experience from start to finish. From the moment we walked in, the warm and inviting atmosphere made us feel right at home. The staff was incredibly friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable, offering excellent recommendations without being intrusive.

The food was nothing short of spectacular. Every dish we ordered was beautifully presented and bursting with flavor. The steak and lobster was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the oyster was the perfect finishing touch—light, delicious, and memorable. You can tell that fresh, high-quality ingredients are a top priority here.

What really sets BOHO apart is the attention to detail, both in the food and the overall dining experience. The ambiance is cozy yet refined, making it an ideal spot for both intimate dinners and special celebrations.

Overall, I can’t recommend BOHO highly enough. The combination of outstanding food, top-notch service, and welcoming atmosphere makes it a must-visit. I’m already looking forward to my next visit!"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,Fresh seafood cooked to perfection.  Friendly fast service.  The fried baby squid is excellent.
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"When in Vung Tau, this restaurant is a must. Absolutely delicious food."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,The restaurant is interesting! It’s definitely worth a try if you’re into seafood! Highly recommend if you are into experimenting with different types of fish
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,I have traveled to this city many times but the dining and scenery here are really great and the staff is friendly too.
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,Very good service and nice food! We tried the vip room and got access to music on top.
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Fantastic food
Great Staff
Excellent Value
Mr Phuong was extremely brilliant to us"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Good steakhouse, and seafood soup.
Near KAT with coffee"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"I rate this 1* so that the owner would see and take the action.
- Everything is great here, from the hard working servers to the delicious food cooked by the experience cooks.
- So, why 1*?
- I'm a 35 male Vietnamese, and I haven't been experiened a slow and stupid management system for drink (maybe food too) like this.
- Let's not talk about technology, if you're a human being, you won't let your guests wait for more than 30 minutes for their 1st drink, would you?
- It's how it works there, and 2nd drink? You asked, it's the same.
- As being a patient traveller as I am, I was seeing people left after 30m since they had no drink after they ordered them.
- If the owner read this, then read it again, you have a great team working for you, they deserve a better management system."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,The lighting was soft and created a relaxing environment
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,Lovely restaurant with a great view. Great service from Mr Phuong

ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Delicious food, reasonable price, very good service!! Should experience everyone"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"If you come here on holidays or weekends, I think you should book a place in advance or if possible, some snacks to keep your table and be served faster, because the food and scenery here are very beautiful, so most weekends or holidays here are very crowded with diners from everywhere to visit, as for the scenery, there is no need to mention, in the light windy afternoons you sit and watch the waves rustling along with the sunset gradually fading, extremely suitable for family trips or maybe a couple's date, the food here is diverse, especially seafood, you can choose the type of seafood you want to have it prepared right at the restaurant's aquarium, not only that, there are also other typical dishes of the restaurant such as roasted chicken with sweet fried green bean sticky rice and beef pressed on a smooth rock with side dishes, here you can experience attentive care service and interact with very enthusiastic and cute staff, if Vung Tau were my home, I would choose this place as my first ideal dining place over other food service places."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Delicious, fresh food with good taste. The kitchen seasoned well
I went in early so the waiters were not very enthusiastic.
The seafood was fresh because it was a large grade 1 seafood so the price was higher than other restaurants along the road.
Next time I have the chance, I will take my family to eat there"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The restaurant is spacious and cool, the service is attentive, fresh and cute, the food is plentiful and delicious, suitable for my taste, the dishes are served quickly, overall very satisfied."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"My family has been to Vung Tau many times and has experienced many familiar restaurants, but this time, we accidentally saw a review of BOHO restaurant, so my husband decided to try it out to see if it was as described. The first time I entered the restaurant, the staff was very warm and attentive, making me and my baby feel quite comfortable. The staff member Phong was very enthusiastic, advising on dishes to suit our taste because my family has a small baby.
The dishes were presented very neatly and eye-catching. The taste was delicious. The sea view was very cool even though my family went at noon, eating and watching the sea. It felt so good that all the stress disappeared.
The service staff must be said to be very attentive 😘😘😘.
Thank you to the restaurant for investing very thoroughly, training the staff very thoroughly from the kitchen to the service so that my family had a wonderful experience.
Next time, I will definitely visit the restaurant again."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The salted egg snails are really delicious, the steamed Thai-style clams are also delicious. The stir-fried vermicelli with crab is okay but not very special."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Fresh seafood, fragrant and fatty cheese. I ordered steamed stingray with scallion oil, but the dish served was more like steamed with soy sauce, so you should consider when ordering.
The staff is lovely and polite.
The restaurant is overlooking the sea, so it's still cool at noon."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Beautiful location, right on the beach, I went at noon but it was very cool
Delicious food, especially crab sticky rice
The staff is extremely cute and enthusiastic, taking care of my family like family 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The food is delicious, the staff is super enthusiastic and dedicated! Next time if we come to VT, my family will continue to support you!"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Delicious food, spacious, airy restaurant, nice view, good service, enthusiastic food advice. Will visit the restaurant many times again."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Enthusiastic staff, delicious food, airy space"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"This was the first time my family came to eat, although when we entered, the restaurant was a bit deserted compared to natural snails or Ganh Hao. But the food is really delicious, the seasoning is very impressive, just right, served hot. The seafood is very fresh. Compared to yesterday when I ate at Ganh Hao, Ganh Hao these days seems industrial, the food that comes out is cold and not as polished as before. The service staff is very enthusiastic and attentive to guests. The location is very beautiful, facing the sea. Next time I will visit again. The price is the same at Ganh Hao."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Cool atmosphere, friendly staff, especially delicious and fresh food"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The food at the restaurant is delicious and suitable for your taste
The staff is very cute and enthusiastic. Especially Mr. Phong is very thoughtful in consulting
Nice view"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Just experienced it last Saturday with my family. Fresh seafood, price commensurate with quality, not cheap but reasonable. Attentive and enthusiastic service, the best thing is the super enthusiastic staff, 10d no buts. Thank you restaurant. Hope the restaurant will maintain this quality, will support the restaurant for a long time."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"First time experiencing this restaurant. Delicious food, enthusiastic staff (Phong), airy restaurant."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Tasty restaurant, airy space, attentive service"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"OH MY GOD, EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT 😭🫰🏻

Luxurious, classy, ​​fresh 🥹
You get what you pay for, but in fact, I don't think the price is too high.

My mom and I arrived at 8pm, which was a bit late, but the restaurant still welcomed us warmly and thoughtfully. The snails were big, sweet, the salad was just right, not too salty, not too bland. The hot pot was delicious, the broth was clear and moderate. In general, everything was great :)))) The seating was so spacious. There was even a private VIP room. Everyone who goes to Vung Tau should stop here to try it once and get addicted

The private parking lot is super big, AND ESPECIALLY AT NEAR SUNSET, OH MY GOD THE SEA VIEW IS SO BEAUTIFUL"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The dishes were all praised by the whole family, especially the crab soup with jute, crab sticky rice, grilled fish with salt and chili. The price of a portion seems expensive, but because it was a lot, I felt the price was reasonable.
Went on a Monday lunch so it was just my family, the space was airy.
The service was excellent, my baby was sleepy so the staff put the chair back for him to sleep, the person who held the umbrella from the parking lot enthusiastically ran after me from the parking lot to the dining table, the staff were enthusiastic.
Next time I visit Vung Tau, I will continue to support"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The food was delicious, the interview was fun, enthusiastic and very thoughtful. I am very satisfied with the interview and staff here."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Spacious and airy restaurant. Enthusiastic, cute and attentive staff, delicious food."

Friendly staff
Delicious, fresh food
Affordable prices"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,Delicious food..nice view..very dedicated and attentive staff..very worth for everyone to experience..
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The restaurant serves attentively, welcomes warmly, serves dishes quickly, and the food is delicious."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Food is ok, price is also average, service is enthusiastic and attentive, some staff park cars carelessly, lead cars carelessly, collide with each other 🥲"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,Every dish is delicious and the staff is attentive.
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The food is delicious, the staff is good, Phong is very cute ❤️❤️❤️"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Delicious food. Mr. Phuong's service is very cute and enthusiastic

The second time I came back to VT, I still chose Boho for dinner, crab spring rolls, Fuji beef and grilled pork belly with fermented bean curd are super delicious. The staff from security to waiters are very cute and enthusiastic. It's rare to find a restaurant that is as consistent as this from staff to food and the prices are also reasonable. The most important thing is that it's clean. 10đ"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The food is great, the staff is very enthusiastic and cheerful, so you should try it 😘😘😘"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"This restaurant needs to be more crowded!!

Beautiful location, right on the road next to the sea

Spacious space, comfortable tables and chairs

The staff take care of customers very enthusiastically

The price is mid-range, not too expensive, the food is very delicious, the seasoning is moderate

The crab sticky rice 🦀 is delicious, you should try it

The toilet is bright, clean and fragrant

This restaurant has NO POINTS - NO POINTS TO CRITICIZE

Will come back if I have the opportunity to go to VT 👍🏻"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The space is spacious, airy, the restaurant is beautiful and the view is also beautiful. The food is very suitable for my family's taste. The dishes my family ordered were all very delicious, the stone-grilled fuji beef was extremely delicious, everyone should try it, the sturgeon hotpot and grilled sturgeon were also very fresh and delicious. The manager and staff are very cute and enthusiastic, the day my family went, there was a very enthusiastic staff named Phuong. Everyone should try it if they visit Vung Tau."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The food here is only seasoned so-so, for example, the beef and taro salad, the onions in the salad are extremely pungent, after being shredded, it should be soaked in cold ice water, then soaked in vinegar oil, it would be better, but the taro is not flavored, it tastes out of place. The corn soup has no corn, the snails with cheese sauce also have no corn, maybe the kitchen bought too much corn yesterday??? Not to mention eating snails without toothpicks or forks, having to wait to be reminded. The staff are not professional, for each dish served with a dipping sauce, you have to wait for the customer to remind you, then when bringing it out, there are some bowls of dipping sauce, some don't have any. When asking the customer to pick up the fork to put in the new dish, they turn their faces away and yell like they're ordering a child or a soldier, it's really shocking! The plus point is that the steamed shrimp is fresh and delicious, but the grilled shrimp is very strange, the meat of each one is somehow mushy 🥲"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Delicious food, enthusiastic service and beautiful cool view"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Comfortable space with outdoor and air-conditioned karaoke rooms, delicious and diverse food, enthusiastic staff, our team building here was very satisfying, enthusiastic and attentive staff."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The waiter Phong is cute and enthusiastic, the food is beautifully decorated, a lot of it hihihi"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"At noon on September 1, I stopped by to eat and specifically ordered:
- Oysters with cheese sauce: delicious, cheese is just right, fresh oysters.
- Grilled clams with scallion oil: a bit pricey, but okay.
- Boho salad: should change the menu to include it in the dessert section rather than salad (mixed dish), lots of mayonnaise and fried food.
- Stir-fried vermicelli with crab meat: chili is not processed well, too spicy, no seasoning, bland, I'll say that I normally eat extremely bland, this dish is not just vermicelli, stir-fried, no seasoning, and also bad.
- Garlic and egg fried rice: I ordered this dish because the previous dishes were too bad, but also bland.
- Seafood soup: seafood is tough, the soup has a lot of MSG.
Slow service, I asked for it to take away because it was too bad to eat, but it was super slow. Enthusiastic.

The receptionist is ok, listens to customer feedback but not worth mentioning"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The food is delicious, the service is extremely friendly and cute, the seafood prices are clearly listed, the sea view is beautiful."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Staff + kitchen seem overloaded.
After ordering, we waited for too long and didn't know how to bring out the bottles of water first.
Called to reserve a table but when I asked, I was told there was no name."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"I found the food delicious and suitable for my taste,
Mr. Phong is very enthusiastic, 10 points not available but
I will come back soon"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Mr. Phong's staff is very enthusiastic, airy space, delicious food."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"New restaurant, spacious and clean, delicious food, you should try it, attentive service, especially the person named Anh Phuong is very cute and serves very well😍"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Delicious food, enthusiastic service, the best is crab sticky rice"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"My family ate at this restaurant for the first time.
Advantages:
+ delicious food
+ Fast food delivery
+ Beautiful sea view
+ Enthusiastic and super cute staff (Thao, Linh, Huong 5* served these 3 people)
+ Price and quality are worth the money
Disadvantages:
- going uphill by car and downhill is quite narrow
- basic food, no main dish of the restaurant for diners to try.
Conclusion: 4.5*/5* worth a try if you are tired of Ganh Hao and Co Nen"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Good food. Sea view. Cool. Go during meal time, weekend. Crowded. Poor service."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"First time experiencing food at Boho, the dishes are very tasty. Recommend everyone to try the crab sticky rice, very good quality. 
Spacious space, suitable for families or parties with a large number of guests"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Grilled oysters with cheese are delicious.
Enthusiastic staff.
Fast service and food."

The dish is very attractive and delicious.
I am very happy that my company had a wonderful day of experience.
Thank you restaurant, thank you staff…"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The restaurant is airy, the receptionist and staff are enthusiastic, the food advice is reasonable, the food quality is fresh. Ordered a large mantis shrimp, the shrimp was exchanged for a new one... a tourist area like this is too good. If there is a chance, I will come back. The price is relatively OK..."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"BOHO Restaurant Vung Tau is an impressive destination with a unique space, with a bohemian style that is liberal but still cozy. The restaurant has a beautiful design, in harmony with nature, creating a feeling of relaxation and comfort for diners. 

The menu is diverse, combining Asian - European cuisine with delicately prepared dishes, delicious flavors and beautiful presentation. In particular, the friendly staff, attentive service, help customers have a wonderful culinary experience. This is an ideal place for dates, gatherings with friends or simply enjoying a delicious meal in an inspiring space."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Reasonable price, delicious food. Cool space. Service Tri is cute, cheerful, enthusiastic, and cares about customers ❤️"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"My family was so hungry so we looked for a restaurant, accidentally stopped by to try and found the food very delicious, reasonable price, diverse dishes.

The space has a direct view of the sea so it's very chill.

The service is fast, neat and enthusiastic so definitely when we return to Vung Tau, the restaurant will be our family's best choice 😘"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"✅ Open space, beautiful location, extremely airy. Even though there are many villages, it is not noisy
✅ The staff is a bit clumsy because it just opened
✅ Delicious food 👄 4/5. The price is also a bit high because it's all fresh."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The food is delicious, tasty, fresh seafood. Besides, the service quality is good, especially the staff named Phong is very happy and friendly to support customers. Will definitely come back next time."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,The restaurant is spacious and airy. The staff (Tri) is friendly and attentive. The food is delicious and suits the taste [the food is sour and less sweet]
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Beautiful view, delicious food, attentive staff"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The restaurant has a nice view, the staff is very good, the food is ok.. everyone should come and experience it."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Advantages:
Wide frontage, Parking available, Clean, Next to the beach.
Happy staff.

Disadvantages:
- Waiters don't know how to earn tips from the customers they take care of. (I worked in a restaurant for 3 years, serving at a restaurant, and never got less than 200k in tips each night). I had to fold the ice myself, bring hot pot without fish sauce.
- Fair price
Makes a meal for 3 people not perfect.

This is my personal opinion."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The first time I went to the restaurant with a friend, the first impression was that the space was extremely spacious, with an outdoor area, an air-conditioned room and a VIP area.
The staff were friendly, enthusiastic and served very quickly.
In terms of taste, the restaurant's menu has a wide variety of dishes and mostly focuses on seafood, in addition to pork, beef, chicken and frog dishes.
I ordered 4 dishes that all suited my taste:
Fried squid with fish sauce 179K, fresh squid, hot and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, served with vegetables and pickles so it was very tasty
Shrimp according to the current price (850k/kg) I made sashimi with wasabi and crispy fried shrimp heads, this is my favorite dish so I found it very delicious
Thai stir-fried vermicelli 129K, with seafood, shrimp, squid, fish cakes stir-fried with vermicelli and bell peppers, spicy Thai style, small and chewy vermicelli noodles that are not boring
Beef dipped in vinegar 189K, tender beef, delicious broth, served with raw vegetables, cucumber, star fruit, green banana and vermicelli
If I have the chance, I will come back"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The food came out quickly, no need to wait too long, seasoned well to our taste. The staff was quick, friendly, and enthusiastic. The price was mid-range, our family ordered 10 dishes for 2.5 million."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Mr. Phong's service is very enthusiastic and cute. The food is delicious, I went for the second time and the restaurant is great 💛 My family is extremely satisfied so we will definitely come back many times 😚"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The restaurant I went to on Saturday was a bit crowded but the service and customer reception style was quite nice, I also went on tiktok to watch and read the reviews here before deciding, because my family is quite difficult in choosing a restaurant, the restaurant gave me and my family a great experience, the food took a while to come up, but the thing is, it was all served quickly, the crab sticky rice everyone must try, and the garlic stir-fried snails, the best at the restaurant, the shrimp is also fresh and delicious, the restaurant is airy, the parking lot is super large. 
The staff member Hong Nhung is cute and takes care of customers very carefully, there is nothing to complain about!!! ☺️☺️

The experience was ok when I came to the restaurant, I will definitely come back on future occasions
The photo I took is exactly like the dish, I did not edit the photo

Everyone should book a table in advance to be sure like me"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Beautiful view restaurant
Fast food service
My table was served enthusiastically and friendly by Mr. Phuong.
Reasonable price. Every dish is prepared to taste
There is crab sticky rice, spicy butter squid teeth are very delicious
Will come back to support the restaurant."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The fried squid with fish sauce was cold and fishy. The stir-fried vermicelli with crab had the vermicelli cut short and salty, and the crab was all shells. The stir-fried vegetables were bland. The fried oysters with eggs were terrible, the eggs were still in their shells, the oysters were not fresh and had the shells mixed in. I have never been to a restaurant that was both bad and expensive like this."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Delicious food, fuji beef, reasonable price, Mr. Phuong's attentive service... family will come back next time, hope everyone comes to support the restaurant 🥰🥰🥰"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Spacious restaurant, delicious food. Enthusiastic and hospitable staff."

(Mr. Phuong is a good service person)
Next time my family will visit the restaurant and introduce many people to come."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The first time I visited, I was so in love with it...the sea view was romantic, beautiful, cool, and the food was delicious and tasty. My whole family praised it. The service at the restaurant was friendly and cute, especially Ms. Tram, who served enthusiastically. The price was also affordable, not too expensive. Overall, BoHo is a place worth experiencing. I recommend you guys to try it out 🥰"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Cool, enthusiastic service, reasonable price,"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Delicious food, beautiful view, from the security guard to the receptionist, to the service, very enthusiastic and cute (the waiter's name is Phong) extremely thoughtful, gentle and delicate. Everyone should come here to support the restaurant."

ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"The food is delicious, fresh seafood, Mr. Phong's service is super enthusiastic."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,We visited for dinner and were looking for sashimi-style dishes. The staff helped us choose the right ones. Everyone was very helpful and accommodating.
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"If you’re looking for a seafood restaurant that has delicious food with a beautiful view I definitely recommend this gem!

The seafood is as fresh as it gets, with a menu that showcases the best the ocean has to offer. Service here is just as impressive. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive without being intrusive.

I recommend the fried garlic flavour when it comes to the shrimp."
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"We went to Boho restaurant for dinner. Food was delicious with also suitable non seafood options. However, service was outstanding! Huge thanks to Mr. Phuong who served us fantastically through the evening!"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,Great delicious foods with affordable price and stunning coastal sea view. Good ambient and nice service.
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,"Not a great place for Australians looking for food, we struggled with what we Evan ordered, but the roast chicken was ok"
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,Great seafood restaurant right by the ocean. I highly recommend! Food was delicious and service was very friendly and fast. I will definitely be coming back again!
ChIJaf_lUwBldTERRLQF7VzAPpY,Food is good here! Our server Mr Phuong was attentive and friendly.
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"The oysters were very fresh, and the cooked ones super flavourful. We also had some oyster konjee, very tasty. I am writing this review 24h after the meal so I can guarantee the products were high quality, we had absolutely no health issues. Recommend💛"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Great value oyster restaurant. I initially was just gonna have oysters, but their pasta looks good and cheap, so I tried the seafood creamy pasta and it’s very good with a good amount of seafood in it. As for the oysters, it’s good and they do the seasoning very well as well."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Came here with a few friends. One guy had tried this place a few times, but for the rest, it was the first.

Service-wise, the food came out in a reasonable time. One of the workers perhaps didn't like me giving her a smile when she walked in - I had ordered a trà tắc (kumquat iced tea).. she seemed to be annoyed and didn't ever bring me one. Another worker did.

Otherwise, as for oysters, these were quite good. We tried fresh and various topped ones. They were all good. I don't know the price as it was a group, and we ordered a few dozen and a few orders of garlic bread, one French fry, and one plate of BBQ wings.

We each paid 118K/$4.75 ea for (7 people - 1 person hardly ate so 6 people paid)"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"The interior of the place is modest, but you can see that certain details have been crafted with genuine care and soul. The food impresses both in taste and presentation, showcasing a high level of culinary skill, all while remaining affordably priced."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Wow! Real fresh and tasty oysters in Vung Tau, highly recommended!
This restaurant is a jewel for Vung Tau also with the salad and other food you can order everything taste delicious. We cannot give higher than 5 but it is worth a 10!!👌 😋"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Wonderful place!!! We went in the dinner time, there was good choice of everything we wanted: special grilled oysters, big mix of passion fruit sald and salmon. Very tasty tea. Polite and friendly personal. Stylish interior and atmosphere! Highly recommend!!!! Price for two was $12"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"1 time I ate oysters and spaghetti and everything was fine. But the second time I had ribs and 1 beer for dinner. The evening passed calmly, I drank coconut and went to bed, and in the morning I woke up with a wild thirst and nausea.
Soon I was sick and had diarrhea. It was obvious that there was nothing but meat and their sauce."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Very tasty oysters, we tried fresh, with toppings and coocked in oil with cheese.
Waited one day before addind feedback to see how our stomaches would react and everything is ok.
Suggest!"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Delicious, it was perfect. Oh so tasty, I took the  Chào Cà Hôi, it was fresh aromatic and very nourishing. The service was very attentional by the owner Yen. I will definitely comeback and recommend!"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,Our favorite in Vung Tau. Oyster of good quality with various flavours. 12 oysters are only 139k. Also try other dishes like oyster congee.
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Attention all OYSTER LOVERS!!!!
This is the most greatest place I have ever seen where people are so passionate about the oysters. Here you can try it in any style and also just fresh.
Pleasant vibes, awesome music and the friendliest staff (BTW speaks english)
If I could rate it 20 out of 20 I would do ot!"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,Ngon. The congee oyster is good with nice price. You may choose many flavors for your ordered oyster.
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Cooked and fresh oysters are equally good, well presented and with good service.

Excellent fresh well cooked and presented food."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,The oysters are fresh and succulent. We also had the grilled oysters which were delicious. Must come when you are in Vung Tau.
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Great place! Food is cheap and delicious, the atmosphere is so nice and calm!"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,It's a cozy place with delicious food and friendly staff. I tried garlic butter oysters and Seafood Marinara sauce noodles. Definitely worth the price! 👏
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Delicious food, fresh oysters"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,Amazing oysters here 🤩🤩🤩… Wow excellent making… I’m enjoying staying & buy take away more 3big box Wows 🤩🤩🤩
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,I honestly thought it was something better. I don't understand why such a high rating. The waiter and the cook are the same person.
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"It's worth a visit. If u want to try the best pork ribs and fresh oyster in vung tau. Thumb up 👍

Highly recommended. ✨️"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,Amazing oysters a must try! A picture is worth a thousand words!
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,Apart from heavy fried cheese oyster balls everything else on the menu is easy to digest:)
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Exceptional food with good price. The oyster porridge has such a deep flavor, i could order a second bowl. Definitely a must try when in vung tau."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"I lunched here within 6 grilled oysters. Same evening vomiting and diarrhea begun. Feeling like the oysters were not fresh, just warmed and didn’t grilled properly."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Great taste, good price! Wonderful place! Definitely recommend"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"I recently ordered bbq ribs not expecting much to be honest.  But good lord,  I'm a bbq expert, I'm from America,  lived all over even in Texas for a bit but i had to leave a review after this.

The meat just fell off the bones,  do you know how rare it is to find a place to do that correctly? To be that tender and juicy? To have a sauce to die for? This place is a hidden gem, i haven't tried the rest but if it's like the ribs do not miss it. If it's not its worth it just for these world class ribs!"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,I can't say nothing cause in Europe the oyster taste is totally different..its like to eat noodle here and in europe  scallops are ok but maybe better with just one light sauce price correct
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Tiny place, easy to pass without seeing it. Food is delicious the raw oysters are super fresh, fat and delicious. We tried a variety of grilled oysters and every preparation was awesome 👍"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,Wow wow wow indeed fresh. Why cook the oyster when it’s so small and fresh. I’ve been looking everywhere to find small fresh oysters at a reasonable price. This is by far the best.
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Underrated place in Vung Tau.
Fresh oysters, good variety of dishes with it. Pleasant atmosphere and helpful staff.
Recommended!"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,Just ate some amazing oysters in this little restaurant - its got a nice menu i’ll have to be back to try more!
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"wonderful hidden gem, so polite and friendly, very fresh seafood, we loved it"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,delicious food and affordable price
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,Sooo good! 🔥
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,Delicious food and fresh oysters 🦪 with reasonable price
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Pleasant restaurant, tasty food, helpful staff."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,Ok
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"First time trying a strange restaurant in VT but accidentally chose a super delicious, super top restaurant. Fresh food, super delicious seasoning 😋 the owner is very enthusiastic, I hope more people know about the restaurant 😍"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"This time when we went to Vung Tau, we stopped by to experience the Oyster Box restaurant. The restaurant is located right on the way up to the statue of Christ with open arms. We climbed down and stopped to eat, which was very convenient.
The restaurant is quite small. When we arrived, the restaurant's sign had faded. However, the quality of service and food was very good.
When we went to the restaurant, we ordered food and waited a bit long, about 10-15 minutes. During that time, the restaurant had paper for folding cranes and stars. 10 points of sophistication
I reviewed the dishes as follows:
🦪Grilled oysters: fresh and delicious oysters. The sauce that came with the oysters was very suitable and delicious
🍝Pesto Spaghetti: delicious and fragrant. The salmon that came with it was fresh and of good quality, not fishy. The price was very good
🍖BBQ Grilled pork ribs: delicious, standard European restaurant flavor
🥗Passion fruit salad: fresh, high quality vegetables. The accompanying sauce was delicious
Overall, the restaurant is very good. One small minus point is that the sign is old. I hope the restaurant will fix this part. Rating 9.8/10"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"You can eat fresh oysters.

I was worried because of the hot weather, but both the raw and steamed oysters were delicious.

However, perhaps because of the oyster variety, I couldn't really taste the savory and sweet flavors that are characteristic of oysters.

The steamed oysters were good enough to warrant a trip to the store."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Delicious oysters, reasonable price. Location near the back beach, easy to get to.
I ate at the restaurant so I like it if the restaurant plays some chill music, it would be great 🤭"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"The price is reasonable for this level of quality.
But don't eat the spaghetti. The sauce was really bad. Elementary school lunches and frozen meals are better than this.
I tried four different oyster sauces, and the others were okay, but the mayonnaise sauce tasted like rubber. My friends said the raw oysters and steamed oysters were the best."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Small, pretty restaurant, beautifully decorated. Food comes out quickly, beautifully decorated, neat, fresh oysters, all flavors are delicious."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Delicious food, clean, beautifully decorated. Oyster combo, some spicy if you want to eat, remember to reduce the spiciness. Salmon porridge is quite delicious."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Delicious oysters, fresh, grilled sauce is just right. Delicious porridge
From the outside it looks like it's not delicious but when you eat it, it's delicious, the food is neatly presented"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Although the store is small, the food is really delicious. It seems hard to find this kind of taste at such a cheap price. I plan to eat abalone porridge and grilled oysters tomorrow or the day after."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Overall I'm quite satisfied, give the restaurant 5 paper stars :>

Space: the restaurant is a bit small but still enough for a group of 8-10 if you share tables.

Food: creamy pesto pasta with mushrooms, white sauce pasta (milk cream) and grilled oyster set with salmon and cheese, delicious tamarind sauce.

Service: for bills over 200k, the shop gives away 1 soup, while waiting for the dish you can fold paper :))"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,The food is delicious and the price is reasonable. I like the noodles here. The oysters are not my taste.
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Small, pretty restaurant, gently decorated, lovely service, reasonable prices, specializing in oysters so anyone who loves oysters can come here."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Oysters can choose 2 types of sauce, also very good. Seafood pasta has many toppings. Very okie
Ah, lime tea is only 15k.
The price is very reasonable. Should try"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Edit: 9/2025
Returning to the restaurant after 2 years, the quality of the food is still the same. The oysters are delicious and fatty, in my opinion the best are steamed oysters with mustard soy sauce, the simplest but most delicious.

I will still leave my previous review below!

~~~
The grilled oysters here are delicious, everyone. The oysters are plump and fatty, the sauce is delicious, especially the bacon cheese sauce. The decor is beautiful. The staff is also friendly.

Will come back!!"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"A small cozy cafe with a large selection of oysters in different types. There are also pastas and barbecue meat. The prices are pleasant, the food is delicious. Nice interior and pleasant music."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Found it on google but really satisfied, delicious food, clean, quiet space... everyone who comes to Vung Tau's back beach should come to this restaurant 🥰"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"The restaurant is near the beach, cozy space.
The restaurant has many different dishes. The fries are delicious but I forgot to take a picture.
Highly recommend the Japanese oysters."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"The steamed oysters were incredibly fresh and delicious. The lemongrass and ginger added both aroma and flavor. You can enjoy the pure oyster flavor without any fishy aftertaste. I also loved the four different sauces available, allowing you to choose your own. The abalone porridge was tender and smooth, perhaps because it was boiled until tender. The accompanying cilantro and spicy chili peppers were perfect for your taste. A glass of beer was the icing on the cake. This is a restaurant I'll definitely visit again."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Small tables, but beautiful presentation of dishes. You can choose different fillings for oysters. There are 8 types. Delicious salad with passion fruit sauce. There is barbecue meat and chicken wings. French fries, spaghetti."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"I've been eating there since the restaurant first opened on Hoang Hoa Tham, the quality is still ok but for a long time I haven't seen anyone welcoming customers when they come in. There are probably 2 people, 1 employee and 1 owner, customers don't greet each other when they come in, the same goes for customers when they leave even though the restaurant is small and not too big. This time I found the restaurant quite stuffy, there's also a musty smell like it hasn't been cleaned for a long time, open the door to let in some fresh air."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Small restaurant, very cozy space.
Diverse menu, many dishes to choose from.
While waiting for food, the restaurant has paper available for customers to fold stars, cranes, ...
My group ordered oysters and spaghetti. The oysters were very fresh, the noodles were also very delicious. Rcm the restaurant's cheese dishes.
The restaurant staff is cute and friendly. The restaurant also has wet and dry tissues for customers to use, very convenient.
Next time I go to VT, I will come back."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"The oysters and pasta were really delicious, the oysters were a bit cold, they were pre-made so they weren't hot like the grilled ones. The price was cheap, a combo was only about 100k-250k, the tamarind iced tea and creamy pasta were the best, I feel like I've never had such delicious pasta before =))). The big minus point was that the restaurant only had one person working so the wait was long, we intended to order more dishes but were afraid of waiting so we only ate 2 combos as shown below."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Better than expected!!!
🦪 12 oysters x 3 with garlic butter sauce / bacon cheese / fish egg mayo: Lots of sauce, quite flavorful, a bit salty, adding a bowl of Northern-style lemongrass pepper fish sauce made me feel strange 😆. Points - the oysters are not big, not satisfying to eat.
🍝 Spaghetti with mushroom pesto sauce & Spaghetti with seafood tomato sauce: Ten points 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻. Cheap compared to the deliciousness of the dish.
🍖 BBQ ribs: Lots of sauce, rich, delicious. Ribs are also normal, not dry but not too juicy.
🥖 Garlic butter bread: Delicious.
🥗 Salad with rib combo: Okay.
💵 470k including shipping and Grab discount code. 4 people can eat until half full. Too good 💯."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Frozen canned food, not even warmed up, served to customers. The oysters are as soft as flour, should not be eaten, easy to get a stomachache."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Awesomely delicious oysters! 😍I'm delighted! I highly recommend the set of oysters with different sauces to choose from, oysters breaded with cheese and raw) peach tea is very sweet, you can ask to add less sugar) the prices are excellent)"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"First, the space of the restaurant is quite good, although there are not many seats. Second, what impressed me is that each table has a pack of wet tissues, you can use it as you like. The drinks are also quite cheap, especially the tamarind and lime tea which is very delicious. The oysters have many different flavors, and the wait for the dishes to come out is also very fast. I am satisfied with this restaurant."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"I happened to see this restaurant by chance, I didn't expect it to suit my taste. Next time I go to VT to eat again 🤣🤣"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"The restaurant is a bit difficult to find because it is hidden,

The restaurant space is small, about 5-6 tables, but very cozy. The decoration colors are simple and harmonious, in general, it looks pleasant.

The restaurant has few employees, but the owner is enthusiastic and cute...

Regarding the food, it is quite highly rated because of the variety of oyster sauces. The beef ribs are stewed quite soft before being grilled... in general, 10 points for quality

The milk oysters here are the best, guaranteed to be delicious right away... the oysters are also very tasty, guaranteed to suit everyone's taste

In general, 10 points compared to the price...

---------
Update 8/25/2023
The second time I went to the restaurant, it still did not disappoint me... the food was still excellent and the service was extremely enthusiastic.

My husband and I ate a bowl of oyster porridge and 18 oysters... it was very expensive but only cost more than 200k

Next time, we will continue to support the restaurant"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"🦊Small cozy oyster bar🦊
The menu is good with pictures, in English and Vietnamese, there are even inscriptions in Russian, but in principle everything is clear. We ordered a set of 12 oysters in different sauces, very tasty, fresh oysters. We also ordered pasta with salmon to take away, it was beautifully packaged, the taste was also pleasing, the sauce was rich in pesto.  We drove past it many times because it was a really small room and we only found it through Google Maps.

ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Visited the restaurant because I read almost 5* reviews on Google but it was not as expected, the oysters 🦪 were pre-processed and not fresh. The staff were also not friendly, even though it was T5 evening, the restaurant was only serving 1 table, they didn't say hello when they arrived and didn't thank them when they left."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Jeonbok porridge 55,000 dong. Coke 15,000 dong. Grilled oysters 6 79,000 dong. Total 149,000 dong. About 8,000 won in Korean currency. It's delicious, clean, and reasonably priced. I would visit again. There are only 6 tables in the restaurant hall. It's cozy. I don't know if she's an employee or the owner, but the woman working there seems to really like K-pop. She kept listening to it while I was eating."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"It's okay.
I saw the place was highly rated on Google Maps so I tried it.
The restaurant is small, cozy, and decorated for Christmas (I came at the end of November).
The menu is diverse, with many dishes to choose from.
While waiting for the food, the restaurant has paper for customers to fold stars, cranes, etc., which is cute.
There are dry and wet tissues on the table, no extra charge.
I ordered grilled oysters and oyster porridge. The porridge was very good and warmed my stomach. I didn't like the grilled oysters very much, they didn't feel chewy enough, and the sauce wasn't well mixed. I also ordered grilled scallops, which seemed better.
The staff was polite, but when the bill was paid, the staff ran away, and I didn't have time to tip.
4 stars. Will consider coming back."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Delicious food, cozy space, cheap drinks and the best is the tamarind and kumquat tea. Have come here many times and brought friends here."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"The lady who takes orders is very enthusiastic and friendly. I ordered 12 grilled oysters for 139k. The price is cheaper than other pubs. To my taste, the flavors are all ok but the oysters are not very fresh. Next time I have the chance, I will try other dishes at the restaurant."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"I don't know about Saturday and Sunday, but Friday is quiet. The food is quite delicious. The oyster mix has a unique taste. The price is also reasonable. You should try it to change the taste instead of seafood restaurants."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,Interesting food offer. Oysters with various toppings. Delicious pasta. Excellent combination of price and quality. There is a bonus system for regular customers. We recommend visiting.
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"The food is also delicious, the restaurant is small and cute with cool air conditioning."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Came here because of the 5 star reviews. But the actual experience was terrible, long wait for food. 1 hour for 2 dishes. Oysters were edible. BBQ chicken wings were sour, Cajun chicken wings were very very salty. Will not come back."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Beautiful restaurant, delicious oysters, especially steamed oysters with lemongrass and ginger. Oysters have no sand inside."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Delicious!

1. Menu: This place specializes in oysters, so the outstanding menu has oysters and oyster porridge, with Italian noodles and garlic butter bread.

2. Quality: I tried 8 oyster flavors, I don't like onions so I recommend salmon sauce avocado cream, caviar mayo, garlic butter (still retains the oyster flavor) the other flavors are quite strong, salty, and spicy so I can't feel the oysters anymore.

The minced beef spaghetti is delicious, the garlic butter bread is okay.

RECOMMEND: tamarind lime tea.

3. Price: I think it's okay, because the quality is very good. I went 3 times in May, and each time I got a 20% discount

4. Service: enthusiastic, cheerful, polite, and quick"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Excellent, fresh, and perfectly prepared oysters. I also loved the salmon porridge. I highly recommend it, especially for those trying oysters for the first time!"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,Fresh and clean oysters. Great!
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Very delicious oyster, you can choose your own flavor and accept credit card payment. There are no customers when you go in the afternoon, so you can enjoy it quietly."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Delicious food, quiet chill atmosphere, fresh oysters and seafood, overall ok"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"I ordered 6 grilled oysters (bacon cheese, salmon cream), grilled chicken (bbq, hot buffalo), and french fries. All were satisfying. Especially the fragrant french fries, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, super delicious"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"I found this restaurant by chance and I am very satisfied. I had grilled oysters and ribs with various sauces. It is a taste that everyone, regardless of age or gender, will enjoy. I highly recommend it."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"So cute, the system Vietnamese fast food now aday"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"I love oysters, and they cook them well and in abundance here. They also have a varied menu of other seafood. The place is simple, and the snacks are delicious."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"I don't know about the other dishes, I tried 3 oyster dishes, they were really delicious. The oysters were fat, plump, and had a good taste, especially the green salt dipping sauce was very delicious. I will come back next time I have a chance to come here."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,The oysters here are delicious. There are many flavors to choose from. They also have pasta with ribs or chicken wings if you don’t want oysters. It was fun to see a jar where you can sit and make cranes and stars while you wait.
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Delicious, clean restaurant, affordable price."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Didn't think the food was delicious and cheap like that. The two of us ate oysters, salad, porridge and drinks and were full for less than 5 cents. The owner was enthusiastic and cute. Next time, wear some pretty clothes and there will be nothing to complain about 🥰"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Good porridge, normal noodles, ok oysters. (Personal taste)"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"I eat there many times, every time I go to Vung Tau I stop by, the food is delicious, good quality, clean, air-conditioned space, clean seating, comfortable wet tissue, full variety of dipping sauces, Japanese black bean sauce, tomato sauce, chili, green salt,... I really like the 49k oyster bowl, red spaghetti. Preparing to go to Vtau, continue to support the shop"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"The restaurant is right on the corner of a big street, easy to find. The food is quality and the price is reasonable."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"As soon as you step into the shop, you can smell the delicious aroma. Fresh oysters, bacon cheese sauce is very delicious."

ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"+ Small and cute restaurant.
+ Staff are very enthusiastic and friendly.
+ Specializes in oysters with pasta. All 8 flavors are good. Good quality and price.
+ Will come back when I have the chance."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Specializing in oysters, well-seasoned, small, cozy space, affordable prices"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,Small but cozy restaurant. Fresh oysters. Delicious oyster porridge. Grilled oysters are ok.
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"I read the review that I had to try it when I went to Vung Tau, so I ordered it to eat at home.
Buying on Grab, both the price was discounted and the shipping was free, which was a great deal
The time I ate was 24 with 8 types of sauce
Everything was delicious except for one type of tamarind sauce that was a bit strange.
Overall, the price was reasonable, the oysters were hot and fresh. I will definitely continue to support when I come to Vung Tau next time"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Delicious, nutritious and cheap is real, oysters, cheese and pasta are all delicious, super delicious."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Chill shop style, soft music, handsome waiter who talks softly and cutely, noodles and oysters are okay and pleasant."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Small restaurant and very average food, I had 6 fresh oysters, the oysters were not very cold, I think there was a problem with the fridge, then 6 hot oysters, served with a crab sauce which was excellent, on the other hand the cheese sauce tasted of rancid butter and finished with an oyster salad with Thai dressing, just cabbage and oysters, average, lack of imagination in the kitchen, I will not return to this establishment."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"No, the food came from the microwave. It was simply purchased in aluminum containers. The mussels were spoiled. ⚠️"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"The best oysters I've ever eaten! No, I'm not exaggerating! Definitely recommend it! I'll be back."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"I have eaten at the Vung Tau branch twice, once at the restaurant, once ordered Grab, and I have also eaten at the branch in District 1, Saigon. The oyster porridge here is not only 10 VND but the oysters are full and the porridge is seasoned well. I ate 20 grilled oysters at once in District 1, the garlic butter bread is soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. I have tried many places but this is still the best. Currently, I have not found anything better."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"The restaurant cooks delicious food. My wife and I came to eat oyster porridge, it was delicious. The staff was enthusiastic, the space was very chill. Unfortunately, the picture is on my wife's phone so I can't show it to you 😁"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Very tasty! I had oysters and salad. I highly recommend both! Plus a nice atmosphere, a cute cafe."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,Amazing place! Very tasty!
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Fresh and delicious oysters, reasonable price, I also ordered chicken wings, very good. The restaurant is a bit messy so should be rearranged a bit to make it neater."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Delicious and lovely food
The owner is also delicious"

It was a shame that I ate a lot because I was going for a boat ride. I will definitely come back when I visit Vung Tau."
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Delicious and cheap restaurant, lovely staff <3"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"The food is so delicious, every dish is delicious, from cheap to expensive, there are quality dishes to enjoy, you should try it once when coming to Vung Tau!!!"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Really good! I was disappointed by the atmosphere, but I was happy after eating the oysters!"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Friendly and delicious! The oysters aren't that big, but they're still good :) The taste reminds me of beer!"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"The oysters are delicious and fresh, and the cheese here is extremely delicious"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"The oysters were very fresh, and the cooked ones super flavourful. We also had some oyster konjee, very tasty. I am writing this review 24h after the meal so I can guarantee the products were high quality, we had absolutely no health issues. Recommend💛"
ChIJLfGUrgxvdTER5fKbo2RRrLM,"Great value oyster restaurant. I initially was just gonna have oysters, but their pasta looks good and cheap, so I tried the seafood creamy pasta and it’s very good with a good amount of seafood in it. As for the oysters, it’s good and they do the seasoning very well as well."
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"Update – Another Incredible Dining Experience at Benaras Restaurant, Pullman Hotel, Vung Tau

I had the pleasure of enjoying yet another unforgettable dinner at Benaras Restaurant tonight, and I must say, the experience was absolutely stellar. The Tandoori Chicken was out of this world—perfectly marinated, cooked to tender perfection, and bursting with authentic Indian flavors. A true culinary masterpiece that showcases the skill and passion behind the kitchen.

Special accolades to Anil, the Tandoor Chef, for crafting such a scrumptious and flavorful dish. His expertise in traditional Indian cuisine truly shines through every bite.

A heartfelt shoutout to Rishiav, our host and server for the evening. His politeness, professionalism, and meticulous attention to detail made the dining experience even more enjoyable. Rishi embodies the kind of warm and refined service that keeps guests coming back.

This place continues to impress me with its consistent quality, welcoming atmosphere, and a team that genuinely cares about your experience. If you’re craving authentic Indian cuisine with exceptional service, Benaras Restaurant is the place to be."
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Absolutely phenomenal - exceeded every expectation!**

Where do I even start? This place is an absolute gem! The food is not just delicious - it’s transported-straight-from-India authentic. Every single bite was perfection.

The service? Flawless. Attentive without being intrusive, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about the food they’re serving.

**MUST-TRY DISHES:**

- The black dahl is life-changing - seriously, order it NOW
- Tandoori paneer - melt-in-your-mouth incredible
- The prawn dish - fresh, perfectly spiced, divine

we’re not hotel restaurant people. We usually venture out to find the “real” local spots. But this place? We ate here two nights running as we were working late and would have made it three if we’d stayed longer!

The flavors are so authentic and complex, the portions generous, and honestly, this is the best!!"

ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,Halal place in Vung Tau.. good food.. nice ambience.. friendly staff.. recommended..
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"We had recently booked for our group lunch at Masala Bay (Vung Tau)
The quality of the food was very good along with their warm hospitality. The group has a good time having the meal.
I would recommend this restaurant if you are staying in Vung Tau or coming for a day trip."
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"Even there is few tables on the day, we still had to wait long time for each order that is longer than usual and not basically happened in the 5-stars hotel or restaurant.

However, the taste can be compensated. It’s only one Indian restaurant in a neighborhood that we can find the cooking quality and the price go with the same page. The garlic nan is tasty, even we ate without any curry. Tikka chicken is a bit salty and high herb note but overall is satisfied when dipping with the green sauce. Masala tea reached my expectation for aromatic criteria but the taste is still moderate. I’d recommended to order draft passion fruit beer. It may go well with those dishes.

The atmosphere is as standardized as hotel’s standard but mosquito issue and some concerns about handkerchief."
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"I have eaten here for some time but the standard both of the food and the service (which is shocking) is going downhill. I actually stay frequently at the Pullman Hotel where this establishment is (currently booked for 10 days +). Previous evening with a friend and our chicken main dish, sauce was excellent, was 90% bones 10% meat. Decided to return tonight and after 40 minutes of waiting for my order to be taken I paid for my drink and left. Management need to take a close look at their service. An abundance of people ensuring nothing gets done."
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,We came here for dinner today. The food was great and the staff were very friendly and attentive.
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,Had a wonderful meal. Service was very attentive and our waiters were happy to give advice on the dishes. The food itself was very good. Full of flavour and the rice cooked perfectly.
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"Benaras's number 1!
Service here is impeccable!!! Thank you Rahul for taking extra time to share your personal story with us without infringing.
Setting is perfect for quiet night with loved one or romantic outing. The atmosphere is elegant without fuss and arrogance.
Vung Tau Indian cuisine, very good but can improve. Naan was overworked and ended being on the tough side, but very fragrant and still good. Samosa filling was super but dough lacked layered flakiness.
Worth the visit."
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,Excellent food and service. Superb ambience. Loved butter milk..
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"We had such a delicious meal here! It’s been a long time since I’ve had Indian food this good. We ordered chicken and roti dishes, and everything was absolutely fantastic. The chicken was incredibly tender and perfectly spiced – a real explosion of flavor.

We also had Pani Puri, and the filling was super tasty – fresh, flavorful, and just right.

The only small downside was that the staff didn’t speak English very well, but honestly, it didn’t take away from the experience. If we were staying in the area longer, we definitely would have come back for another visit.

If you love Indian food (or want to try it), you should definitely visit this restaurant. Authentic, flavorful, and clearly made with care – highly recommended!"
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"Delicious original Indian cuisine, polite staff consists of real Indians, both cooks and waiters.  You can choose a table both in the hall and on the terrace.  A varied menu, everything is delicious.  Quiet place, few visitors.  Recommend!"
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,Excellent indian food. Phuchka was perfect.
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"Flavors are decent and especially loved the gulab jamun .. paneer tikka was fresh and tasty .. biryani was alright .. masala dosa was good , however there was no coconut chutney probably due to the time of the day I went in ... The disappointment was the pani puri where was the pani was sweet .. we asked if they could give pani without adding meetha(sweet) to it and they could not give that .. the place is a bit overpriced as well .. however the ambience is elegant .."
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,Table Service abit slow even restaurant looks empty.
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"Had dinner here in Sept 2025 and LOVED it! Fresh, zesty, delicious and authentic Indian food. Would definitely recommend."
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"Great food and service.
Attentive and helpful staff.

Naan bread was awesome!"
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,Jeevan was a great server. Food was delicious at a decent price for the quality. Cozy atmosphere with comfy tables.
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"The Garlic Naan was great and amazingly enough absolutely loved the lemon served with the kebab :)
But the 'millet cream' left a little to be desired tbh"
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"UNSANITARY!! GET IF YOU WANT DIARRHEA!😡If you dont have sanitary hygiene in the kitchen, why bother putting high prices?? i ordered 1mil vdn food and it left me with a diarrhea for a whole night, and had me cold sweating. EXPENSIVE & DISGUSTING 🤮"
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"The best Indian food in Vung Tau, hands down! A true culinary gem inside the Pullman hotel"

ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,We tried the chef's special tasting menu and it was an unforgettable culinary journey through India.
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,The butter chicken here is legendary—incredibly creamy and rich. A must-order for anyone visiting.
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,Highly recommend! The ambiance and service match the fantastic food.
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,We had a delicious meal (mutton rogan josh - a kind of lamb curry with garlic and butter nans)
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"Great biryani and fish tikka we had here. Request for extra spicy and they get the job done, good service specifically for the waiter Mr Rishav"
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,Good food. Halal and fast service

Such an kind and polite person with smiley face ,the way of providing food and taking care of people."
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"If you don't mind high prices and a long wait despite an empty restaurant then come here.

We were 7 people. Mutton Jogan Rosh was good but the Palak Paneer was superbland. We were the only table but food took way too long.

When served the staff brought the curries and the Jeera rice for my friends but not the plain rice for me and my other friends so we just had to continue our wait...

Thankfully the garlic naan was good!

My bill of 2 dishes plus 1 rice and naan, shared with one friend, ended up at 1,5 million VND with sparkling water and 2 orange juices."
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"Delicious Indian food. I highly recommend the paneer masala, saffron rice, and garlic naan. Service was good."
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,Very nice food and excellent service. I’m a returning customer and was up-to-date never disappointed.
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"Just had a great chicken kadai, great service and friendly waiters definitely worth a try."

ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,Good food and  awesome services. Best experience in Vietnam ✌️✌️
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"Food is delicious, but 7€ for a bottle of water it's definitely too much as well for starters and bread.
Lemon ice-cream (on stick) was poor.
The venue itself is great, but the music in loop (always the same jingle for 2h) was quite annoying."
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,One of the best Indian restaurants in Vietnam somehow exists in Vung Tau. I have never been disappointed.
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"Food is good, but they changed their menu and changed items are not available to serve…..very big disappointment. Not sure what was the idea to change the menu if you are serving it….may be just to attract customers???? Can play some Indian instrumental music to improve the atmosphere. No lassi or butter milk served. Menu is very limited to have a choice. If the restaurant is having an Indian chef then it should be bespoke to customer request. May be portion can be increased to have a more value for money. As an Indian culture a glass of water must be offered first….I am staying in a hotel so it’s a honey review…. Not sure whether management will improve on it… specifically to changed menu…"
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,Very nice Benaros Restaurant for Indian food. You get the real Indian taste.
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,Exceptional! Every dish was a celebration of authentic Indian spices.
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,Nice food nice staffs here
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"Food was nice, (and Halal certified as per stamp on the Menu) had a meat and fish dish.
A bit on the pricey side but as mentioned food was nice, nice atmosphere and decent timing regards to service. Polite and attentive staff.

Only one criticism would be the meat/fish to sauce ratio, would have been better if there was  a little bit more protein and a little less sauce, considering the price of the dishes (each of the dishes had literally 4 pieces of meat/fish)"
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,I try CHOLA BHATURA it was awesome taste…. I recommend who find indian taste on vung tau ❤️❤️❤️
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"We have been travelling through South East Asia for a month and got a craving for Indian food. And this place hit the mark. Food was good. Service was outstanding. Our server Akshay who was pleasant, diligent and very professional."
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,Authentic Indian taste. It's a great feeling to talk to some Indian who lives locally in the country you have been to travel. Same feeling when I spoke with Akshay. Had a nice chat. He is very loving and polite and gave good recommendation for food.
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"I eat paneer butter masala and chole bhature. The food was very good, staff's friendly and service also good. I will come back"

One of the authentic  indian resturant is Banaras masala. Chef lokendra is very good chef."
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"This is a wonderful restaurant. The food was top quality, the chicken tikka was the best I have ever had. Many respects to the Chef! Mr Rahul and Ms Hong Ngoc were excellent, professional and attentive service. Thank you very much, we will come again!"
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,Food was delicious. Special mention to rishu who took great care of us.
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"If you are looking for a fine dine, expensive restaurant to have Indian and Vietnamese cuisine together, then this place definitely recommended , but if you guys are travelling to Vietnam and you came to Banta to have Indian foods, you can check other option as well, because in vung tau , have many other options, other places are budget friendly 👍"
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"Absolutely loved this Indian Cuisine, me and my partner have been away from the UK a long time and that was better than some Indian Restaurants back home. The hosting was exceptional and the chef even made changes to my dish when asked. They do have another menu if looking for something different but there's no point going to an Indian and passing on this fantastic menu.
Highly highly recommend"
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"Goood food

ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,Resturant Decor and ambience top notch.Tasty food and excellent service
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"Just perfect 👌  enjoyed good test and ambience,  nice food, felt homely"
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,Tuesday 30th April. We just went for a meal. Wife ordered butter chicken as her go to meal as it as she told the waiter she does not like too spicy. She also ordered entrees of samova which as standard come with two tips one of which is a mint coriander yoghurt mix. It was 10 out of ten hot. I asked the waitress to dress the heat level down by adding 50 percent more yoghurt. She said with a straight face this is indian food and if it is too hot just don't eat it. However it is a big part of the dish. I had to sternly tell her to take it away and add the yoghurt. My dish was roganjosh which came in a sauce which was OK but thinner than a standard soup. It flowed straight through the rice so spoiled the dinner which I had to eat with a soup spoon to get the source in with the meat. Overall very disappointing dishes. The redeeming feature was the amazing young man playing saxophone while we ate. 10 out of 10 for him. I wish he could have cooked dinner as well
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,True delicious food. Very nice ambience. Real five star hotel. And so are all things.
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"Amazing masala , naan, samosa , chicken, the flavors are super authentic of India ."

ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,Really good food and nice atmosphere. Recommend the cheese naan.
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"Great food and service. Came here for dinner, place was very quiet with only one guest, but still the food was amazing and service was excellent."
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,Excellent Indian food and professionnal courteous staff and great service. The chef is even coming to enquire if everything is to our taste !
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"Confusing beyond words. You ask for help and then are told to wait because the staffing is intertwined with staff moving to accommodate Pullman Guests and the Benaras guests. The concept is a concept not an actuality. What’s worse is that nothing was done about seating, removing empty plates when finished, attentiveness and just having a simple smile for wanting people to eat at an establishment. If I wanted Indian food in India - I would visit India. It seems foolish to let people walk in and think the establishment works - it simply doesn’t. (TRUST ME - I DO NOT LEAVE REVIEWS BUT I HAD TO FOR THIS ONE BECAUSE I TOOK MY PARENTS HERE and it was terrible). The photos make it worse."
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,Great food.. highly recommended

ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"The food was actually very good but the service was terrible and the price was outrageous.

I paid $30 for one meal. I understand it's a hotel restaurant so foods going to be a little bit more expensive, but it's a hotel restaurant in Vung Tau, not Manhattan."
ChIJt02RAu1vdTERQkTmDekMWr8,"Really great food, stunning environment, quick service and very friendly staff. Prices are very fair considering the quality and standard."

ChIJqZr9AAAtCzEROqZ6L0RJU10,"The place looks amazing. Very serene. Water everywhere. You can hear the water flowing. And lots of places to take good pictures as well. Food was really good. We were part of a tour group, so it was a set 7 course menu. Everything tasted wonderful. Orange, our waiter, was so kind and helpful. Everything got delivered on time."
ChIJqZr9AAAtCzEROqZ6L0RJU10,"A Delightful Experience!

We initially planned a quick stop, but the charm of this beautiful restaurant convinced us to stay for lunch — and we’re so glad we did! The place is tastefully decorated, filled with natural light and fresh air, creating a relaxing and inviting atmosphere.

The food was absolutely delicious, and the staff were exceptionally friendly and courteous.

Full marks for the positive vibe, beautiful ambiance, and mouthwatering food. Highly recommended!"
ChIJqZr9AAAtCzEROqZ6L0RJU10,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ | A Perfect Start to the Day!
Had my first meal of the day here and it did not disappoint! The food was delicious — fresh, flavorful, and truly authentic Vietnamese. The staff were very warm and accommodating, making the experience even better. The cozy and aesthetic vibe of the place just adds to the charm. Definitely a spot I’ll be coming back to!"
ChIJqZr9AAAtCzEROqZ6L0RJU10,"We had lunch at Sol Cu Chi after our Cu Chi Tunnel tour, and it was a great experience. The place was clean, modern, and had a pleasant ambiance. The staff were genuinely friendly and accommodating, making us feel very welcome. The food was of good quality—flavorful and well-prepared—though the serving sizes could be improved. Overall, a solid spot to relax and refuel after the tour."
ChIJqZr9AAAtCzEROqZ6L0RJU10,"Sol Cu Chi Restaurant is a delightful find for anyone craving authentic Vietnamese cuisine in a warm, welcoming atmosphere. From the moment you walk in, you’re greeted with the comforting aroma of herbs, spices, and simmering broths that promise a memorable meal.

The menu features a rich variety of traditional dishes, but the **signature Cu Chi-style pho** and **fresh spring rolls** truly stand out — beautifully presented, perfectly seasoned, and clearly made with care. Their **grilled pork vermicelli** is another must-try, with tender, flavorful meat and a perfectly balanced fish sauce dressing.

What sets Sol Cu Chi apart isn’t just the food — it’s the genuine hospitality. The staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, often offering recommendations or a quick explanation of the origins of certain dishes, which adds to the experience.

The ambiance is cozy yet modern, making it ideal for both casual lunches and relaxed dinners. Whether you’re a longtime lover of Vietnamese food or new to it, Sol Cu Chi delivers a heartfelt, high-quality culinary experience every time.

Highly recommended — a true taste of Vietnam in the heart of the city!"

However, I was quite disappointed with the way the place is managed. While I was dining, the manager repeatedly shouted at the staff in a loud voice, which disrupted the calm atmosphere and made the dining experience uncomfortable."

ChIJqZr9AAAtCzEROqZ6L0RJU10,My first ever meal in Vietnam and the much awaited chicken pho which i have been waiting to eat for so long was awesome. Beef in lalot leaves was a new experience for me to eat. Had a full stomach of my  meal. The place also was clean and service was prompt !!

ChIJqZr9AAAtCzEROqZ6L0RJU10,Doremi was our server and she did an amazing job. The meal was incredible and the service was top quality. Thank you Doremi!
ChIJqZr9AAAtCzEROqZ6L0RJU10,"If you’re planning to eat here, or here as part of a cu chi tunnel tour, just be aware the 5* reviews are requested by staff when you finish your meal. It was the worst place we ate in Vietnam, which was actually really surprising to us given the high ratings, and generally nice look of the place. However unfortunately we could finish none of the dishes we got, (Vietnamese pancake, pork spring rolls, crispy tofu), they were all just that bad. The service was incredibly disorganised, three different servers taking the orders of a single table, no co-ordination, some people had almost finished their food by the time others’ meals were arriving. To top it off it’s probably the worst value for money of any place we ate, our food and 2 drinks amounted to over 600k. Tax is excluded from the prices on the menu, but looking back that still seems very high?"
ChIJqZr9AAAtCzEROqZ6L0RJU10,"Food was very enjoyable the service was impecable, the atmosphere was quiet and alluring. If I ever come back to this area I'm sure to dine here again."
ChIJqZr9AAAtCzEROqZ6L0RJU10,"Really enjoyed going here after our Cu Chi tunnel tour. The food is satisying, fresh, and it really gave us an elevated take on the Vietnamese cuisines. Highly recommended."

ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"I ate for 3 people for nearly 1.3 million, I think it's worth the price because
The space is beautiful and polite, family, dating, meeting partners is also ok
I ordered fish hotpot, seafood hotpot, beef. The ingredients are all fresh and delicious, fresh shrimp not frozen and mushy, the fish pieces are thick
The soy hotpot I ate was strange, light and fatty from the beans, if you like a strong flavor, skip it, if you like a strong flavor, order Tomyum hotpot.
My favorite is the vegetable counter with the toppings, I'm a vegetable lover so I have nothing to complain about. My friend also ate curry rice at the buffet counter
Dessert is also self-selected, there is Taiwanese tofu, Bingsu, and fruit
With this price range, I think it's OK and different from the current hotpot restaurants. If you like to experience a hotpot for 1 person with a similar style, there is Baoz hotpot in the Sora area ^^"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"The food here is delicious, from vegetables to meat is very fresh, but one thing is that before ordering alacarte, each person must order a main dish first, but I think the price of the main dish is also very ok and a lot, I went with 2 people and ate for about 1 million VND
The service staff is enthusiastic and good
If you eat here, you should reserve a seat in advance.
It is worth experiencing hot pot for 1 person"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"This restaurant is half Japanese and half Chinese, the style is Japanese but the tissues are in Chinese, I ordered 2 seafood hot pots, the hot pot broth was not good at all, the food was very normal, had dinner at 4pm, did not eat since morning, lunch was the same because I was busy with work, I made an appointment to eat with a friend in the afternoon but found nothing special, the seafood dipping sauce was also bad, the drinks were okay, only Coca not Pepsi, as for the whipped cream, it was quite normal. The price is acceptable. 3 people, 3 hot pots 1.2 million. Nothing too expensive but the food should be improved. Especially the hot pot broth. This is the review of 3 people, not my personal review.

The service attitude is good, the staff are quick, polite, and cheerful.

Thank you for reading, I will come back later to edit the review when the restaurant improves."
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"2025/05/31 17:03

❌️ Ordered an Australian shoulder steak (339K) which was terrible, full of fat and disgusting
❌️ Bubble tea (62K) is not okay either, don’t spend money on drinks, just drink the grass jelly honey from the self-service bar
⭕️ The fried chicken, grass jelly and shaved ice at the buffet are good. The cup of vinegar served before the meal is delicious.

I feel full after eating but I don’t know what I ate. I feel empty. Daily life in Vietnam🤪"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"The ingredients are fresh and the buffet is also of high quality

Taiwanese hotpot is amazing

I came to celebrate my birthday, thank you for the attentiveness of the staff and the boss

It was a happy birthday, thank you for singing and taking photos"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"Perfect experience
The food and service are both great
All-you-can-eat buffet, fried food, desserts...
In one word, awesome

There is also a birthday event for the birthday person of the month
One person gets free for four people, it's a good deal
No limit on the number of times, it's available within the month
I must find friends to come together🥰"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"This restaurant has just opened recently, the model is also strange so I tried it. 

The restaurant sells hot pot dishes with beef, pork, seafood... 

The slightly different point of the restaurant is that you have to order 1 meat dish to choose 1 pot of hot pot broth, the cheapest is about 260k-300k per portion of meat, and everyone sitting down to eat must order. It's like a buffet ticket but in the form of ordering. You will be able to use the line counter freely, with no limits on vegetables, mushrooms... desserts... 

I am very satisfied with the quality of the hot pot broth and meat, fresh, politely decorated, beautiful. I think the hot pot broth has stewed beef bones that are worth eating, light and refreshing, Tom yum is a bit sour. 

The line counter is diverse, the side dishes such as fried chicken, fried tofu... fruit, sweet soup are very ok. Especially the ice cream machine is very fun, I ate that dish 3-4 times. 

The overall space is very beautiful, but a bit cramped when crowded.

The staff were polite, it was very crowded that day but they were still very nice and enthusiastic. 

In short, I rate this as a pretty good restaurant worth trying. However, if you go with a group of 4 or more people, the price here is a bit higher than if you go to a regular hot pot restaurant."
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"I didn't expect to be surprised when I came to eat hot pot. It's the first time I saw so many instant noodles on the wall. They are all my favorites. I really hope I can try every flavor. Unfortunately, my stomach is not willing to cooperate! The food at Takizawa hot pot is so delicious. I hope I can come here every day."
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"The cold side dishes are delicious and refreshing, better than Haidilao's side dishes. The fried food area is very popular with children, especially the chicken nuggets and popcorn chicken. The hot pot ingredients area highly recommends bean curd skin."
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"The restaurant is very nice, comfortable seating, the food is okay, neat but not too excellent, the price is quite high. 2 people plus milk tea is about 1.3 million. The free food line counter is not much, there is a fresh cream machine. HouCaiLei milk tea is sold in the same system on the menu, but I have to say the price is expensive (60-70k for a cup of tea) and it's boring to drink 😑"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"The staff on the morning and afternoon of August 15 were very nice (I suggest raising their salaries), the food was delicious, the bingsu was very delicious, the beef was fresh and tender, the hot pot tasted just right."
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"Fresh and delicious food, should book a table in advance on weekends to avoid long waiting, 500k is a full meal worth the money"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"Very chill space
Attractive and delicious food
Very polite and professional staff
Rate 10/10"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"I ordered the Brazilian pork belly today! The meat was incredibly fresh! The tom yum broth was sour and spicy, and it was appetizing! The buffet ingredients were incredibly fresh and clean! Lots of options! Highly recommended!"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"The beef is tender, the vegetables are crispy, the fried food is excellent, and the curry rice is even better!
The pre-meal vinegar and the dessert are the icing on the cake!
Watching the little bear slowly sink into the soy milk
I feel so happy!"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"Great, quality food, buffet counter is filled continuously, 299k for 1 plate of meat, free buffet, water, bingsu... too much food for 1 person."
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"delicious food, fresh and tender beef, delicious hot pot broth, delicious bingsu, must try, the staff are very enthusiastic, I lost my luggage reservation slip and they helped me find it very enthusiastically"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"The service is very good and the food is delicious😋
There are many choices and I will eat here again🥰"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"Diverse food, price suitable for quality, friendly and enthusiastic service"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"Very nice restaurant, very good service, very delicious food 🤤"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"Delicious broth, fresh and varied food. Reasonable price"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"actual review, the food is exactly the same as manwah but more expensive.
the food is not fresh so I say it is exactly the same, including the hotpot broth. And you can't order a refill for the main dish, you can only eat at the buffet counter, this counter has a variety of dishes and is very delicious.
the most confusing consultant on earth."
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,Everything was great service better than expected
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"Friendly service, fresh ingredients, this is my second visit, highly recommended"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"The restaurant space is beautiful and luxurious, the food prices are very reasonable, and there is also a free line counter. Must try"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,Experience a new way of eating hot pot with rich flavor... I find it suitable and delicious. Everyone should try eating beef bone hot pot with pennywort... suitable taste
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"There is a Taiwanese store manager directly providing service outside, which makes you feel like you are back in Taiwan in a second.
But the focus is still on her service attitude and enthusiasm. Nothing to say, just a thumbs up"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"Every 2 weeks when I go to Dai Nam, I come here to eat. The hot pot is delicious, the space is private, the food is fresh, the broth is clear and delicious. But I still wonder when it will be available in Ho Chi Minh City!??"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"The food is delicious, the atmosphere is nice, the prices are reasonable, and it's perfect for a gathering!"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"The food is delicious, the environment is clean, and the ingredients are rich. It is worth recommending to open a restaurant in Phu My Hung City to serve the customers there."
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,Super beautiful and spacious space. Enthusiastic service. Wow 💚
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"Delicious food, enthusiastic staff!"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"The meat portion is quite large, the dishes are good, and the variety is ok.
The curry rice is delicious! The fried food is good! The chicken nuggets are surprisingly solid!"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"The dishes are fresh, with a wide variety, and the beef is affordable. There are Chinese waiters, so communication is barrier-free. I will come again next time."
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"The beautiful boss is very friendly ~ the food is fresh, I have visited many times"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,All you can eat at the buffet! The soup is delicious and the meat is fresh😍
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"The ingredients are very fresh and there are many choices for soup.
Lots of meat ~ I always feel full and satisfied every time I come here"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,Food was fresh and plentiful. Service was very good.
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"Modern space, lots of toppings, delicious hot pot broth, will come back many more times 😋😋"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,Delicious food. Friendly staff.
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"Good Taiwanese hotpot, and the location is very convenient in the supermarket, and there are Taiwanese tea drinks to order"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"Delicious food, beautiful and luxurious restaurant space"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"The taste is numbing but not spicy, plus the vegetables are all you can eat, full of rich food, making people's appetite"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,The service attitude is very good. The ingredients at the buffet are fresh and the meat is also good. I will come again next time
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"Unfortunately, there was no staff and the service was slow. The main course was expensive."
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"The food here is delicious, looks very eye-catching + the staff is very enthusiastic 🤗"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"A lot of food, very delicious, the cost of food per person is the same as manwha haidilao but the quality and quantity of food is more"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"A very good hot pot restaurant, with a lot of meat, and all-you-can-eat vegetables, very satisfying 👍"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"Taiwanese friends in Vietnam can come and eat, there is a new hot pot option 👍🏿"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"The hot pot is delicious, in a set form, each person only chooses 1 hot pot flavor and then chooses the set menu to eat together, the set price is about 400-1 million depending on the type, the line counter mainly has vegetables and noodles or spring rolls,... there is a place to make your own bingsu and many types of toppings to eat with it, quite ok"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"I love the staff here!
Great food!"
ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,The food is delicious and the atmosphere is great

ChIJYafMJKXRdDERCPtAVFFKxTo,"It's a little different from Japanese hotpots and has an image of being for Vietnamese people, but it was easy to eat."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Friday 17th October 2025:
Good experience to visit and see how the NVA were so aware of their own surroundings and used them to their advantage.
Plenty to visit on the site, but it gets extremely busy with tourists, and we were there at the start of the season.
You can use the rifle range whilst there: hand gun (cant remember which one), and M16.
I was informed they charge $2 per round, so if you want a full clip, thats gonna cost.
Enjoyed the visit, it was just too busy, its one of thos early morning jobs you need to be there as soon as it opens to get total enjoyment"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"If you in Vietnam must visit Cu Chi for experiencing the mind blowing war techniques against American.
Vietnam is a country that truly captures the heart of anyone who visits. The people of Vietnam are among the most welcoming, humble, and kind-hearted individuals I have ever met. Their warmth and hospitality make visitors feel at home from the very first moment. Whether in the bustling streets of Hanoi or the peaceful villages along the Mekong Delta, there’s always a smile to greet you and a helping hand ready when needed.

The culture of Vietnam is equally rich and inspiring—a perfect blend of tradition, resilience, and grace. Deeply rooted in family values, respect for elders, and community spirit, Vietnamese culture reflects a harmony between the past and the present. Festivals, music, and art beautifully showcase the nation’s history and pride, while its cuisine—fresh, flavorful, and balanced—perfectly mirrors the Vietnamese way of life: simple yet deeply satisfying.

What stands out most is the people’s positive spirit and their ability to find joy and strength even in challenges. Their respect for nature, tradition, and human connection is truly admirable.

Overall, Vietnam’s people and culture leave a lasting impression—a reminder that kindness, simplicity, and unity are the true essence of a beautiful life."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,It is a symbol of Vietnamese people's resilience. Going through the tunnel was one of my thrilling experience in life. You will feel anxious while entering into the tunnels. Lot of tourists are visiting this place but still able to explore all the tunnel areas. There is a shooting area where you can practice shooting with M14 or other guns. We also got opportunity to ate cassava prepared by Vietnamese and it tastes good. Our tour guide was so knowledgeable and explained all the things nicely.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"I’m really happy I got the chance to visit Cu Chi Tunnels — it’s an amazing and emotional place. The guide told the stories so well, it made me imagine what life was like during the war. It’s hard to believe people actually lived and fought from those tiny tunnels. I couldn’t go inside because the air felt too heavy for me, but just walking around and listening to the history already touched my heart. It’s both impressive and sad at the same time — a real reminder of how strong the human spirit can be.
#it was raining during visit, i suggest you to come early in the morning to avoid rain and traffic."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"We visited the Cu Chi Tunnel on Sunday. It is one of Vietnam’s most significant and popular historical attractions, located approximately 55 km (around 1.5 hours) from Ho Chi Minh City.

I highly recommend visiting with a guided day tour rather than going on your own. There is so much detailed history to learn about the Vietnam War that only a knowledgeable guide can explain effectively. The tunnel system here is incredibly extensive, stretching over 250 km underground as our guide shared.

What you will see and experience here:
•	Narrow tunnels built for escaping and hiding during the war
•	Small spaces and hidden rooms where soldiers used to stay undetected
•	Underground kitchens with cleverly camouflaged smoke outlets
•	Weapon-making rooms and storage areas
•	Sleeping areas, meeting rooms, and various underground living setups
•	Models explaining war strategies, traps, and daily life of Vietnamese soldiers

The most fascinating part is experiencing the tunnels yourself. The tunnels are extremely narrow, dark, and complexly interconnected. It is truly unbelievable how soldiers moved and lived inside them. It was difficult even for us to crawl a short distance, and experiencing it gives you an immense sense of respect for their courage and endurance.

Additional notes:
•	The entire site is located amidst a dense forest area. If the weather is hot, it can feel extremely humid and uncomfortable, so carrying water, a cap, and wearing comfortable shoes is highly recommended. In pleasant weather, the walk becomes enjoyable.
•	There is a large souvenir shop to buy local items and handicrafts.
•	You can also try shooting at the shooting range (note: this activity is chargeable and not included in the entry ticket).
•	Entry ticket costs around 125,000 VND, and I have uploaded a photo of the ticket for reference. This was included in our day tour package.

Overall, visiting Cu Chi Tunnel was an inspiring and humbling experience, showcasing the intelligence, resilience, and determination of Vietnamese soldiers during the war. If you are in Ho Chi Minh City, this place is a must-visit to witness an extraordinary part of Vietnam’s history."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"The site shows the underground network used by the Viet Cong, with narrow passages you can crawl through, traps and weapons on display, and guided tours that explain daily life during the war. It’s undeniably touristy — some areas feel staged, and the shooting range adds to the spectacle, but it still delivers powerful insight into the resilience and hardships of that era. Worth visiting if you want to understand the war beyond the textbooks, though be prepared for crowds and a somewhat commercial atmosphere."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Visiting the Củ Chi Tunnels was an eye-opening experience. The guided tour was informative. Walking through the narrow tunnels really made me appreciate the resilience and ingenuity of the people who built and lived in them. The site is well-maintained, and the displays, including traps and weapons, are fascinating. I highly recommend this place for anyone interested in history and culture. Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared for some crouching!"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"If you are going to go here, make sure you find a guide who knows a lot about the place. The travel is a bit farther out, so you will want to make the most of it. Some of the tour offers you will find on Klook have guides who will take you there and share some basic information, but if you want to enjoy the experience, make sure you find a knowledgeable guide.

That said, we still enjoyed being able to see the tunnels, the displays, and the bunkers. You will have the option to walk through some of the tunnels aside from the famous photo op where you lift the cover of the manhole. There are tanks there and also a shooting range, but we didn't opt to try that out.

It's hot, so bring a cap and water, and a mini-fan if you have it. Expect a lot of walking and dust. Remember that it's a literal part of a jungle so don't expect it to be like other museums or educational experiences!"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Took us about an hour from city centre.

The attractions are a showcase of war time tactics used by the soldiers during vietnam war. Most of it are a recreated version.

I tried a 20m tunnel. It was challenging due to my size. It is not for those who are claustrophobic. It is narrow, less oxygen and if crowded with people behind you make it even more discomfort.

The shooting range seems to be main attraction as the crowd is huge with long queues. It will take an hour plus before you could get your turn. A barrel with 10 bullets to be purchased is also pricy.

Tour guides are very good they make the attractions even more dramatic with their explanation."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"If you visit Vietnam the Cu Chi tunnels are as the ware museum a must to get a understanding of the history of this country. You get a feeling about jungle live in different station. Most impressive, with going trough this narrow tunnels. But just do it if you feel comfortable with that! We did it with a tour from Ho Chi min, is recommendable."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"The Cu Chi Tunnels are about 50 km from Ho Chi Minh City, but definitely worth the journey. I always prefer renting a motorcycle when I travel, and the ride to Cu Chi was great, I got to enjoy the views, pass through local villages, and see everyday life of the Vietnamese people along the way.

The tunnels themselves are an eye-opening experience. You learn a lot about how the Vietnamese soldiers lived, fought, and survived underground during the war. The tour includes hidden entrances, traps, underground kitchens, and even a chance to crawl inside a real section of the tunnel. It really shows the toughness and creativity of the people during that time.

This place is not just a tourist site, it’s a deep look into Vietnam’s past. Highly recommended if you enjoy history and adventure!"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Cu Chi Tunnels offer a fascinating glimpse into Vietnam’s wartime history and impressive underground ingenuity. The guides are knowledgeable, and it’s definitely interesting to see how the tunnels were used. However, it’s located quite far from Ho Chi Minh City expect over two hours each way in heavy traffic, which makes the trip feel long and tiring. The shooting range was also a bit of a letdown, not as exciting or well-organized as expected. Most bullets for automatic guns were soldout. Overall, it’s worth visiting for the history, but be prepared for a long commute and some underwhelming parts of the experience."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,We didn’t want a big tour so we got a taxi there and paid entry. We wanted to go at our own pace. We we were forced to sit down to watch a video for ten minutes about the history of the tunnels. We didn’t want to watch the video. We wanted to go and explore. The staff said no you must sit down. We tried to get up to explore but we were told again to sit down until the video finished. The video was blurry and inaudible. The video eventually finished and a staff member said they were going to take us around. This should’ve been made clear from the beginning when we didn’t want to watch the video. I would’ve happily waited for this reason. Being told to sit down and wait until the end of the video made us feel like we were being treated like children. The tour took about 45 min in total. The guide was very good.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Visiting the Củ Chi Tunnels was such a fascinating and eye-opening experience! The site is very well organized, and our tour director did an amazing job explaining the history and significance of the tunnels during the war. Walking through the narrow passages really gave me a sense of the determination and resilience of the people who built and used them.

I also appreciated the way the tour combined education with hands-on experience — from seeing the hidden entrances to actually crawling through parts of the tunnel system. Everything was safe, well maintained, and respectful of the history.

This is definitely one of those “must-see” places when visiting Vietnam. It gave me a much deeper appreciation for the country’s history and culture. Highly recommend!"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Somewhat entertaining and informative. The main reason for our visit was to shoot the M-60 machine gun. When we in the part of the tour where you can shoot the guns we were informed that they ran out of bullets for the M-60 (we were there before noon). The only gun that they had bullets for was a carbine which would have been my last choice but that's all that they had.

We paid for the ammo and were directed to the firing range. Apparently they don't maintain their guns very well, it jammed five times while going through one clip.

If the main reason for your visit is to shoot the guns, I would advise against it."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,Very cool. Guides were funny and informative and made sure everyone could make use of the experience. The tunnels are tight and not recommended for big or unfit people. You could chose to go through one or more tunnels no pressure to do too much. If you are skinny it is super fun to try to fit through the smallest holes. Would recommended to make the trip from HCMC if you are there.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Historical place, visiting this place is recommend, so many things to learn about Vietnam war , have a real gun shooting place can visit that and try, cost is little high so be prepared. U can get tickets nearby to hotel or in hotel in ho chi min city, or in klook or others."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Wow, what a creative idea by Vietnamese.

The tunnels were used by Viet Cong soldiers as hiding spots during combat, as well as serving as communication and supply routes, hospitals, food and weapon caches and living quarters for numerous North Vietnamese fighters."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"A pretty cool place to visit, especially if you’re interested in or want to learn more about the war against the US. Lots of practical examples from the war, and it’s also possible to travel through some tunnels and experience what it was truly like! A must see place when you’re in Vietnam. Fairly easy to book tours whilst staying in Ho Chi Minh City, they will organise your transport to and from the site included in the price."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Visited the Củ Chi Tunnels yesterday — it’s about 1.5 hours from Ho Chi Minh City (expect traffic during rush hour). There’s an entry fee, and as a foreigner you’ll also need to pay for a guide, but it’s worth it.

The site gives you an incredible look into Vietnam’s wartime history — how people dug and lived in tunnels during the war. It’s like an underground city stretching over 250 km. Of course, you can’t explore everything; they show you a few entrances and short sections, so you get a feel for it without going deep inside.

Plan to spend at least 3–4 hours here. There are food stalls around if you get hungry, and also a national defense shooting range. The shooting costs about 600,000–650,000 VND for 10 rounds. If you’ve never tried shooting before, it can be an interesting experience, but since the guns are fixed to the railing, it’s not the same as holding them freely.

Overall, it was a fun and very educational visit — definitely a must-see to better understand the history of the Vietnam War."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
A Journey Through History Beneath the Ground
Visiting the Cu Chi Tunnels was both eye-opening and unforgettable. The site offers a raw and powerful glimpse into the resilience and ingenuity of the Vietnamese during the war. Crawling through the narrow tunnels, seeing the hidden entrances, and learning about the wartime strategies made history feel real.

The guides were knowledgeable and passionate, sharing stories that added a deeply human layer to the experience. It's not just a tourist attraction—it’s a tribute to survival and determination. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to understand Vietnam beyond the surface."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"The tunnels were very cool though you want to get there early in the day to avoid the crowds. There’s a lot to learn about the American war, and if you’re in Ho Chi Minh City for a couple of days they’re definitely worth visiting."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"We enjoyed our few hours here. We had a guide which I highly recommend. We learnt so much
as he was so knowledgeable on this topic.

The area is so well set up. You get a real sense of what it was like for both sides of the war

Very well run

I’d suggest getting there early before all the big buses arrive

3/4 of us shot the guns there. They have a AK47 and an M45 which you pay by the bullet

There is a great cafe there offering food and drinks. Reasonable prices too

Watch out for the big centipedes everywhere. I’d suggest covered shoes not just thongs"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,This was somber and awe inspiring. We went to the tunnels furthest from HCMC and it was not very busy. Videos from the time of the war play before you enter the tunnels. Please do watch this as really helps to understand how the tunnels functioned. QR codes are dotted along the way for you to learn more. The gift shop is well priced. We also went to the firing range and shot an AK-47. You have to buy min 10 bullets at approx $4aud a bullet. It's expensive but how often do you get to shoot a gun like that?!
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"During the war, Vietnam defended itself using guerilla warfare, relying on stealth and sabotage to fight a superior military power. To support this, the Vietcong had a vast network of tunnels that lay beneath much of the country. Here you can see a part of the tunnel network they used.

To get to Ben Duoc, the site that hosted the tunnels, you can get a bus from Ho Chi Minh City. The public buses run past the site, so it's not hard to get there.

Ben Duoc is more than just the tunnels. It's a whole tourist destination and museum, with other activities you can try, including a shooting range where you can fire various weapons.

The site hosts war memorials, honouring those that sacrificed their lives to liberate the country. Near the entrance is a temple, a place where people can pay their respects.

There are many displays of weapons in Ben Duoc, giving an impression of the amount of munitions used in the war. Many spent bomb cases and shells, howitzers, and disabled rifles bring you into the world of Vietnam at war, when guns were everywhere.

Scattered about the site are several destroyed and damaged vehicles recovered during and after the war. Old tanks, jeeps, helicopters, and even bomber planes are on display.  They're impressive to see even in their ruined state.

The tunnels themselves provide a guided tour so you get an explanation of everything as you go through the exhibition. Before being shown the tunnels, you are shown a brief movie that gives an overview of the tunnels, how they played a part in the war, and how they were used to help plan the Tet Offensive.

Our guide was good at both being entertaining and informative, teaching us history and encouraging us to interact and explore the tunnels. We were allowed to crawl in and actually see and feel what it was like down there. The tunnels here have been widened and have lights installed, so they're a little easier to navigate than they were during the war, but you still get a feel for it.

You will also be shown the kind of traps that the VC used during the war, as well as several mock scenes of what life was like in the tunnels.

At the end of the tour we got to enjoy some local Vietnamese food while we talked about our experience. It was a educational experience, and one I would recommend to anyone interested in the history of the Vietnam War."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"I recently visited the Cu Chi Tunnels and it was such an eye-opening and unforgettable experience. Learning about the Vietnam War on-site made everything feel so real and emotional. I was truly amazed by the creativity and resilience of the Vietnamese people—how they were able to live, move, and survive underground in such extreme conditions is just incredible. It’s a powerful reminder of how thinking outside the box can make the impossible possible.

You actually get to experience the tunnels yourself, and let me tell you—it’s intense! The temperature was around 22°C, which helped, but you still have to bend, squat, crawl, and slide your way through tight, narrow passages. It’s physically exhausting, but also really fun and totally worth it.

One of the highlights for me was the shooting range. You can try out some of the actual types of guns used during the war. I got to fire one, and it was both thrilling and surreal—like stepping straight into history.

If you're visiting Vietnam and want a deeper understanding of its history, this place is a must-see. Just wear comfy clothes and prepare for a unique, hands-on adventure!"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,Visiting the Cu Chi Tunnels was an unforgettable experience. The guides explained the history very well and gave us a real sense of how people lived during the war. Crawling through the tunnels was both exciting and eye-opening. It’s a must-see if you want to understand Vietnam’s past.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Must visit. It was an amazing experience to know how the tunnels were made and used by the locals during the war times.
Do visit the shooting range and walk through the tunnels. Worth the money!"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Amazing experience! It was very interesting exploring the tunnels and learning the history, but obviously be aware this can be a sensitive subject for Americans. The guides will tell you how long each tunnel is so you can judge for yourself if you want to go in."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Very impressive what the Vietnamese build during and before the Vietnam War.  3 layers up to 12 meters deep. I barely fitted in the tunnels so I couldn't go to level 2 or 3. I was only capable of doing a few meters. Be prepared to sweat. Because it is hot and with a high humidity. I even saw some Vietnamese sweat 😆 for the first time during my current 3 weeks tour in Vietnam from North to South. Anyway, this is a must see. It is beyond you expect. But being an additional shirt 😉"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Must visit historical place near HCM. Really gr8 to see how vietnamese people has protected themselves during the war.

Good to see still the tunnels are properly maintained. Very exciting to visit inside the tunnels with new experience

Good place to have shooting experience with AK47 gun."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"A very interesting place and you do get an idea of the ingenuity of the VC and the skills they employed to remain hidden. The main issue I had was that it is too crowded even if you go early, and this leads to possible panic in the tunnels, so I just didn’t bother as there were too many people. The other issue was putting the shooting range near the cafe, really unpleasant and loud! Really good information video in one of the huts/sheds. If it’s possible, go on a quiet day. I enjoyed the tapioca lunch and tea. Would be better if they limited the numbers by using a booking system."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"had a wonderful time here! so interesting to learn about the tunnels & the entire underground world. super tight & hot inside the tunnels so beware of that, but the guides will allow you to wait for the rest of your party on the outside if you don’t feel comfortable going inside. our guide was wonderful as well! with that being said, we did feel a lot of confusion for the shooting range. the first man we talked to said the minimum bullets you could buy was 5, so we said ok we will get them, but then he walked away and someone else came up
& said the minimum was 20 bullets & then when we tried to ask why that the other man said 5, he completely dismissed us & was just extremely rude:(it was just really disappointing because that was something my brother wanted to do, but we felt as if they were trying to scam us so we decided against it."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"As we were visiting independently without any tour guide, we visited the Cu Chi tunnel of Ben Duoc. We traveled by booking on Grab and it took us 2 hours to reach there. We were quite skeptical as we were on our own, but the guides were there and guided us very well. He explained to us about the history of the Vietnamese war and the significance of the Cu Chi tunnel in simple English. We even had the experience of the tunnels.
You can even get to enjoy boiled cassava, the food eaten by the people during the war, after the end of the Cu Chi tunnel visit.
A temple nearby is also a must-visit after Cu Chi."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"We arrived by boat , early before all the tourists which I can heartily recommend. This is a very informative activity. We learnt about the location of the tunnels, and the difficulties of living, cooking, fighting and creating these tunnels. People were offered the opportunity to get into a tunnel (it’s tiny) as well as crawl through tunnels that have been enlarged for big westerners! You can taste cassavas which was a staple. You can also choose to use ak47’s and machine guns in the shooting range for an additional fee. Afterwards there is a video to watch but the sound is so poor that’s it’s not really worth it.
Get a guide, makes all the difference!"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Very cool! I loved the history of it! Got down in one of the holes to hide against the enemy’s! And we went down into the tunnels too! Omg! 1 metre height.. and you can go for about 100 metres I believe, but there is a way out every 20 metres. Apparently the 1 metre height was made later, and it was actually half a metre! How sad for them. What a horrible situation for war.
The whole place was fantastic definitely worth going. You can also shoot a riffle where you pay for bullets. I didn’t do this and just waited for my group. The one thing is I think they should give the ppl waiting the ear muffs! It was SOOOOOOOO LOUD! Too much! Omg. Like definitely ear piercing!"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"I had the incredible opportunity to explore the Cu Chi Tunnels, a remarkable testament to resilience, ingenuity, and the indomitable spirit of those who fought during Vietnam's turbulent history. Walking through the narrow, dark passages, I gained a deeper appreciation for the strategic brilliance and courage of the Vietnamese soldiers who used these tunnels as a vital part of their defense.
The experience was both humbling and eye-opening. It’s one thing to read about the history, but entirely different to physically stand where history was made. The ingenuity behind the trap systems, the hidden entrances, and the underground living conditions truly showcase human resilience in the face of adversity.
A huge thank you to the guides and local experts who shared their knowledge and stories, bringing the tunnels’ history to life. This visit has left me with a profound respect for the resilience of the Vietnamese people and the importance of remembering our shared histories.
If you ever get the chance, I highly recommend visiting the Cu Chi Tunnels — it’s a powerful, educational, and moving experience that connects us to the past in a very personal way."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Significant infrastructural development has transformed the Củ Chi Tunnels complex since three decades prior. The construction of modern visitor centers, amenities, and curated historical exhibits has been implemented to support its growing role as a key tourist attraction."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Very educational with lots of displays and hands-on activities.  A bit of walking but paths were good (but might be slippery in rain).  You get to go inside tunnels -- difficult to walk with very low ceilings, but there is an exit every 20m so you can get out at your choice."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,One must keep atleast 6/7 hours to see this great place. It was really very informative. My salute to Vietnamese people of those time who with their limited resources defeated mighty Americans. Actual length of tunnel was 250 km and Vietnamese used to hide inside when attacked and come out in night and attack American base camps. They had made all arrangements to stop flooding during rains and also made provision for fresh air to come inside. A lot of traps were made over tunnel due to which a lot of Americans were injured or killed. Overall 58000 American soldiers were killed in this war. Nowadays they allow tourists to see only 100 meter of tunnel with exit at every 20 mt. One has to crawl to go through this. Old and claustrophobic people shoul avoid the tunnel. There is also a firing range where one can shoot with AK47/M15. A guide is a must here. Don't miss this place if you are in Ho Chi Minh.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"An eye-opening experience. Can't imagine how the Vietnamese people used to live with their families under the small, dark tunnel. A bit of caution though - the tunnel crawl is not for the weak on the knees. Better bring some knee pads if you plan to do some crawling.  The next day I had some knee problem from the tunnel experience."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Great experience of the historic war tactics of the Vietnam soldiers, amazing tour. Gun firingalso available AK47 firing for 10 bullets at 650k."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Nice historical place Vietnam and USA war place can see many different tunnels and which is used in the war Guns , vehicles, equipments AK47,etc everything is there and also have guides are there they will explain very clearly and once you see all done there then they will give you one kind bamboo fruit to eat with peanut very tasty 🤟✌️😊"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Had a wonderful afternoon with Ms. Sunny from Vietnam Adventure Tour, booked via the Viator app. Choosing a non-touristy small group was a great decision — minimal queue for the Cu Chi Tunnels and even for the ladies' washroom!

Ms. Sunny was engaging, always smiling, and spoke excellent English. She, along with the very capable driver, made the experience smooth and enjoyable. Despite being briefly stopped by the police (for the usual “coffee money”), the driver kept everything efficient and got us back to Ho Chi Minh City on time for dinner — which I really appreciated!

The afternoon tour was an excellent choice — the weather was cooler and more comfortable. I even had the unique experience of firing an AK-47 — half a magazine cost 1.3 million VND, and it was totally worth it for the adrenaline rush.

A well-organized and memorable tour. Highly recommended!"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,Many small tunnels that have been preserved since the Vietnam war. Learning the history was a good experience too. Would recommend anyone who is into history to visit this amazing tourist attraction.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,The war tunnels that were once a survival passage and now tourist sites for individuals like me who never experienced war to feel how it was like traveling underground in an enclosed space while life is at risk.  I had a remarkable time but would highly recommended to come on a mild weather day to ensure it isn't too hot
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,A must-visit for anyone interested in the war history of Vietnam. The Cu Chi Tunnels offer a fascinating and immersive experience — walking through the actual tunnels used during the Vietnam War gives you a real sense of how the Viet Cong lived and fought. The guided tour is informative
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"If you like history, you will really enjoy this place.

Special mention to my tour guide Wing who is very resourceful and energetic! A fun guy to talk to and very nice. Ping me if you want his number lol"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"02 May 25’

Me and my superior lead a tour group of 72 tourists ( 2 buses), the journey from downtown takes 2 over hours to visit Cu Chi Tunnel, nothing has improved overall.

Narrator for each station should used potable speaker 🔈, because my tourist hardly can hear what they trying to explained.

Secondly, toilets need yo add more rooms, with 72 tourists, you can imagine how long it takes!

Thirdly, if there is a restaurant there could be better, because journey back to town is another 2 over hours or longer if there is a traffic congestion, late lunch for my customers isn’t good at all!

Fourthly, with the current technology, I believe the organisation could consider video screening hall, to introduce Cu Chi Tunnel and the stories of Vietnam war.

Last but not least, not all the  tourists will like the experience & paid for the raffle firing, as such, what else for those who is waiting around?!"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Cu Chi Tunnels are a shining symbol of the bravery, intelligence and indomitable patriotism of our army and people during the resistance war. The exclusive tunnel system, built with strong will and extraordinary creativity, has become an impregnable fortress underground. Every meter of tunnel, every secret cellar tells the story of silent sacrifice and determination to maintain self-made independence. I would like to express my admiration, deep gratitude and respect for the heroic spirit of Cu Chi land, ""the land of steel and bronze""."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Must visit place when 1st time visiting HCM city.

Purchased ticket from Klook which included a tour guide with entry to Cu Chi tunnel and the firing range close by.

Activities (9/10) - Must try the 50m tunnel crawl experience. Could be improved by having a video presentation of the war. Would also be fun if could dress up as a Viet Cong soldier. Must try shooting with a rifle, eg. AK47 - bullets cost Vnd65k each, moq is 10.

Ben Duoc site has less tourists as meant for locals.

Only need to experience it once."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"We went there twice: once with an organized tour incl. english speaking guide and once on our own. Getting there by rented car on a Tuesday afternoon turned out to be a good decision because there were hardly any other tourists. The entry fee was very cheap and the English speaking guide was very fluent. It's like an interactive museum and quite impressive at that. However a minimum level of fitness is required to explore the small tunnels. Not recommended for people with claustrophobia. But even if you don't go into the tunnels, the walk through the jungle and learning about the war is already worth the visit."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"You can experience World War II and Vietnam War sites in person — the old, worn-out weapons are full of historical traces. It’s hard to believe they lived underground for such a long time. Definitely worth a visit."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,Excellent visit to Chu Chi Tunnels near Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. Very Informative and interesting Tour of underground tunnels explained by our Tour Guide.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"The tunnels were dug during the Vietnam War by Viet Cong soldiers as a way to move undetected and launch surprise attacks.

You can also experience the tight squeeze firsthand by crawling through the tunnels with different meters below from the ground and fire assault rifles at the shooting range (Bullets are priced at 60000VND each). Guide is also included in the package who will explain the history and take you through the whole place. The guides also demonstrated how they set many deadly traps.

Note: Have bug spray with you and dress code for hot and humid weather."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,only enjoyed our time here! Booked our tour via Klook 😋 it’s a place with rich history and a very insightful tour experiencing the tunnels for our ourselves! would recommend you bring along mosquito repellent and come in long pants if you can!
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Booked a private tour through Vietnam - Ho Chi Minh City Package Tours on Viator app, not a good app and not an organised company.
First tried to contact the company the day before the tour, no answer to email and no calls getting through. Contact Trip advisor who run Viator app and they also can't contact the company. Asked for a refund and they wouldn't do it until they can talk to the company which didn't happen until the evening, so no answer and no protection for the customers.
The company send massage in the morning to confirm pick up on the tour date. Visit Cu Chi tunnels and walk around for 1.5 hours. Travelling time to and back from Cu Chi tunnels was 4 hours from district 1.
The Cu Chi tunnels itself is interesting but the shooting area is way too loud especially when you actually force to walk past it without ear protection to get out from the path."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Memorable experience at HCMC. The site located quite far from the city center. Booked the trip with THK Travel on tiket.com. It was a great experience, both the service and the experience on Chu Chi Tunnel. Must visit if you’re in HCMC."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Cu Chi Tunnel is around 44 Km away from Ho Chi Minh City. It takes around an hour to reach by road.
This place is a beautiful village surrounded by rice paddy.
This place gives a glimpse of war between America and Vietnam army. How Viet villagers and soldiers fought with American army. How they lived underground  and survived for so long.
Government has well maintained this place.
They also have fire range for shooting with Pistol, AK45. One should try for the life time experience.
They also have Shop selling souvenirs. Washroom were provided and are clean.
This is must visit place once anyone visits Vietnam."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"It is a fantastic place . Show how vietnamese people cleaver to fight with the USA . They invent an brinay ideas to fight . They have very simple weapons against the strongest country in the world, also you can play shooting in many kind of guns there ."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"A fascinating and immersive insight to the Vietnam war and the Cu Chi people of Vietnam. We enjoyed our two hour tour with a great guide.

At the shooting range you can pick a gun out of 3 options (AK47, Carbine, Pistol). The cost per round is 60,000 VND and you are expected to buy a minimum of 10 rounds.

There are multiple other attractions on-site which have separate charges. So ensure you check for it while buying your tickets.

We rented a bike for 150,000 VND for a day to reach the location (takes about 2 hours) which is the best option if you wish to enjoy the ride on the way and explore local restaurants en route.

There’s 200km of tunnels where one can easily get lost - an amazing feat! You get to try a 40m and 15m tunnels which are altered for tourists to fit in. Either way you get a real experience of the tunnels and appreciation of what life must have been like during the war."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"If you’re visiting Vietnam, the Cu Chi Tunnels is a place you have to visit. They hold incredible historical significance to Vietnam, due to their involvement in the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s. Tunnels used during the war have become well known in Western culture, through movies like Platoon, and games like Call of Duty Black Ops.

You are able to see many interesting things while you’re here, such as secret tunnel entrances, various bobby traps used by the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong, and even an old American tank that remains lying where it was crippled during the war.

The Cu Chi tunnels should be visited, not just because they are an incredibly interesting historical site, but also because they serve as a reminder of the atrocities and the horror that occurred in the Vietnam War. Both sides dehumanised and did extremely evil things to one another, and this should never be forgotten.

I would recommend having a local guide to guide you through the site, this way you will get more knowledge and insight from them, and be able to ask them questions as well. Our guide was fantastic. He spoke to us about how the war affected him growing up when he was a little boy.

Overall I would highly recommend visiting the Cu Chi Tunnels. 5/5 stars."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"A perfect not so crowded spot, a bit longer drive but worth it. Do try the tunnels if you dare"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Went to Cu Chi Tunnel this month and honestly… it was super cool but also kinda intense. I never realized how smart and creative the Vietnamese soldiers were during the war. Crawling through the tunnels (which are tiny btw!) was such a wild experience. The guide explained everything really well and made the tour fun too. If you’re into history or just wanna see something different outside the city, this one’s worth checking out!"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,Amazing experience.  If you like to know more about the vietnam war this is an excellent plan to do while in Ho chi Minh city. There are many tour agencies that offer the trip with guide
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,Very cool experience seeing the tunnels and going down into them and seeing all the different aspects of how the VC lived. And shooting a weapon at the rage with live bullets is something you can’t do everywhere.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,Learned a lot about the history of Vietnamese war and crisis. They have preserved it pretty well for tourists to see and hear from the tour guides.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"If you're in HCMC or surrounding areas, it's a must go for those who like history. I would recommend going with a tour guide as they will also drove you there and it's around 2 hours to get there but it's well worth it and very very interesting."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,Worth the trip although going back and forth to the area was quite exhausting. The tunnel experience also can trigger claustrophobia so might not be for the weak of heart.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"What a fantastic experience and place to learn more about the Vietnam war and history around it. This place was one of our stops on tour and our guide was amazing. You can go through their tunnels, up to 100m which is quite small and narrow if you are anything above 1.85m I would say. (I'm 1.94m and had to crawl through). Place is maintained well and give you a real feel of how it would have been back in the day. There is a shooting range too where you can shoot a variety of weapons. A must visit if you are in Viëtnam"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"I went here by a tour guided by STTtravel. I booked by Klook 2days before.
The guide man was very nice and we learned a history of Vietnam and about Cu Chị Tunnel.
There are lots of trap for American soldiers.
It’s not so a Grotesque content that children can also enjoy.
In addition, we can try shooting.
I could feel there was a battle field."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"A 250 km tunnel that connects outskirts of ho chi minh to saigon river. It's so narrow. You get to walk a 20 ft tunnel that would take you 2 minutes to pass through jus for experiencing. We realized that it's so dark narrow and suffocating if you are claustrophobic you should pull yourself together when you start sweating or palpitating while you are inside. Just re-lived how during the 24 year war period Vietnam people had been navigating through these tunnels that too carrying weapons on their back. It needs a lot of courage and a purposeful mindset to go through these kind of phases... Hats off, and I know most of the countries might have gone through many such scenarios for freedom and during wartimes but everybody's story is important, struggle is big and wins are of pride for themselves.

Our guide was a ex militant."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"All the
planes
Tanks
Jeeps
Jets
Gives this place lots of extra things to look at.

The tunnels were very narrow and low clearance . Which was funny because most people were wearing Tongs and shorts."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Visiting the Củ Chi Tunnels was an unforgettable experience! The tour gave us a real insight into Vietnam’s history and the incredible resilience of the people during the war. Walking through the tunnels was both exciting and eye-opening. The guides were very knowledgeable, explaining everything clearly with fascinating details. The site is well-preserved, with plenty of displays and activities that make the visit even more engaging. Truly worth the trip – highly recommended for anyone visiting Vietnam."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"I had a great time visiting this historical site! Just a little heads-up if you're coming from Ho Chi Minh – the traffic can get pretty crazy, and it might take you around 3 hours to get there and another 3 to head back. But honestly, it was an interesting and informative experience, and I think it's definitely worth the trip! Enjoy your adventure!"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,The place is amazing. An actual size where Vietname communist war against the US army. The bunkers and tunnels are just wow. The traps were ingeniusly made.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Amazing experience seeing the history of what was experienced by the soldiers from all participants.   The traps, the conditions and the tunnels are brutally honest.  No wonder soldiers returned scarred emotionally."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,This was one of our favourite trips we did in Vietnam - very interesting and sobering to understand more about how the Vietnamese survived life in the tunnels. Our teenagers enjoyed the tour too.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"The most important, must see experience in Ho Chi Minh City. The tunnels themselves offer insight into the nature Vietnam war that simpy CANNOT be found elsewhere. Tunnels aside, the various traps and other exhibits make visiting a worthwhile investment."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,The place is so quiet and full of stories. We took the private car that saves us alot of money and time. We bought tickets at the entrance gate and walked about half kilometer to reach the entrance of the tunnels. It is good to have a tour guide inside and not from the travel agency  because he only handles ours small group. Our tou guide is also funny and that makes our tunnel experience fun.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Visiting the Cu Chi Tunnels was an incredible and eye-opening experience, offering deep insights into Vietnam’s history and the resilience of its people. We had booked a tour group, and the bus picked us up from the Old Quarter, making the journey convenient. The ride itself was smooth, and after reaching the site, our guide walked us through the history of the tunnels, explaining how the Vietnamese soldiers dug them by hand using basic tools, enduring immense hardships. These tunnels played a crucial role in their victory during the Vietnam War, allowing them to outmaneuver and resist much stronger forces.

There are two tunnels that visitors can enter, and going inside was both thrilling and humbling. At times, you have to crawl through extremely narrow spaces, truly experiencing the conditions the Vietnamese soldiers endured. The guide led us through the tunnels, ensuring safety while sharing fascinating details about their strategy, survival techniques, and daily life underground.

It was a great and lasting experience, making history come alive in a way that books never could. Highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Vietnam! After the tour, we were conveniently dropped back at the District 1, wrapping up an unforgettable day."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"The whole new experience of diving into Vietnam Culture where people are fighting for survival. Crawling through dark narrow tunnels made me realize the struggles and sacrifices they faced by. Must go if you are into loving to know culture, history and tons of emotions.

Tips - There are many ways to go there.
1. Booking tour services with guide
2. Rent Grab and negotiate price for return with driver (they wait for 2 hours normally)
3. Public Transportation (2 transits)

I chose 2 which is more convenient than public transportation and more cheaper than option 1. No need to worry to go there without guide because there are government tour guides to guide you through the tunnel and explain in detail."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,Fascinating and well worth the trip. The tunnels are very small though so not something for anyone who doesn’t want to bend a lot or who has wide shoulders
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Very interesting and organised. There was a lot of tour groups, it did feel a little rushed at times but felt I learnt a lot."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Cool experience for sure. Since most of the tunnels you can see have been “modified for tourists” it felt unauthentic. You can also shoot different real guns here but you will be paying over 500,000 VND. Despite feeling inauthentic at times I would still recommend a visit for tourists."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"A fascinating insight to the Vietnam war and the Vietnamese people. We enjoyed our two hour tour with a great guide. We arrived by speedboat (takes about 1:15 hours) which is the best option as it’s a great ride down the river.

There’s 200km of tunnels - an amazing feat! And if you go down one - just for 20 metres or so you get a real appreciation of what life must have been like during the war."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Nice experience. But long walk not mentioned too much in reviews and descriptions. Not for elderly or persons with limited walking. Other than that, 10/10 for me!

A must visit when in HCM!"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Definitely worth place to visit, not such tourist place compare to Ben Dinh tunnels which is overcrowded with tourist groups. I visited place Saturday early morning and was alone with tourist guide
Much more authentic place, really enjoyed it."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Informative & fun experience. Recommended! It can get dirty if you enter the tunnel, so dress appropriately."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,Must see experience while in Ho Cho Minh-city. My girlfriend and I had a great time and learned a lot about the living conditions in the tunnels and the tactics used in the American war.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,The cu chi tunnels it was a very good experience with the Vietnam war as 15 year old they let us to shooting with a real gun they explained the history
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"The tunnel complex left a strong impression. Crawling through a section of the narrow underground passage that had been widened for visitors was quite challenging, with the humid air adding to the atmosphere. Seeing old bunkers, hidden entrances, and wartime relics gave a clear picture of what life must have been like. The guide’s stories added depth and made the visit both educational and memorable. Certainly worth the visit."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"I visited the Cu Chi Tunnels on a private tour, and it was an unforgettable experience. Traveling by private car allowed for a more relaxed and personalized journey, as we had the flexibility to go at our own pace and avoid the crowds of group tours. The drive itself was comfortable, and our driver was punctual and accommodating.

Upon arriving at the Cu Chi Tunnels, I was amazed by how well-preserved and informative the site is. The history of the tunnels, which were used during the Vietnam War, is both fascinating and humbling. I had the chance to explore the tunnels, which were much larger and more complex than I had imagined. It was incredible to see the ingenuity and resilience of the people who lived and fought there.

You can experience shooting in the shooting range where you get to see multiple rifle versions to choose from.

Since it was a private tour, I was able to take my time exploring the various sections of the site, including the traps, living quarters, and the underground network. My guide was knowledgeable and answered all of my questions in detail, making the experience even more enriching.

Overall, I highly recommend visiting the Cu Chi Tunnels if you’re in Vietnam, and I definitely suggest opting for a private tour if you prefer a more intimate, tailored experience. It was a great way to immerse myself in the history without feeling rushed or overcrowded."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Highly recommended! My son and I went there on January 27, 2025. We were very impressed with the guided tour. John told us about the place and the Vietnam War; it brought me to tears. We booked our half-day tour via Klook; it was very easy—pickup from our hotel and drop-off at the hotel."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"I never thought I would be able to visit this place…let alone to be able to WALK through it! Absolutely incredible how these tunnels are so well-preserved, and the public is able to learn the history about them. The tours are well-orchestrated and informative. Different interactive sections are available for you to get a more in-depth knowledge of the Cu Chi Tunnels and how they were used during/after the war. Our tour guide was not only knowledgeable but funny! He made this an even greater experience!!!"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,The guides were very knowledgeable and shared great information and insight. Going through the tunnels allowed me to have a better understanding of life in the tunnels for thousands of Vietnamese people.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Cu Chi Tunnel is a must-see for those who visit Ho Chi Minh City and would like to know more about the history of Vietnam especially their revolutionary struggle against French and American colonizers.

Expect some physical activities especially if you want to try going through the tunnels. You will also learn some Vietnamese historical trivia along the way.

For gun enthusiasts and even for those who just want to experience firing rifles used by the Viet Cong, they also have a shooting range."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Awesome experience.

ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Always on my bucket list. now I've achieved it. Really lived up to my expectations and thoroughly enjoyed it all.
Lost my bloody glasses though 😂"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,Learn about how Vietnamese survive during War wirh USA. Vietnamese were so brilliant and really patient by hiding under the man made tunnel.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Loved it! Super cool to learn about the Vietnam war firsthand. Our guide actually fought in the war and was very informative. If you’re into history at all and you happen to be in Vietnam, definitely check it out."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Well worth the experience, one of the best tours here! It's not just holes in the ground, it's complex tunnels, life under ground, war strategies and more...doont miss this tour!"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"I recently visited the Cu Chi Tunnels, and it was one of the most surreal experiences I’ve ever had. I had seen these tunnels in movies and documentaries, but actually walking through them was on a whole different level. It’s mind-blowing to imagine how people lived and maneuvered underground during the Vietnam War. We crawled through the 100-meter tunnel, and let me tell you—it felt much longer! The heat inside made it feel like a sauna, and you really have to squat and shuffle to make your way through. It gave me a new appreciation for the conditions soldiers endured.

The site itself is incredibly well-preserved and full of interactive exhibits that bring history to life. From seeing the hidden entrances and clever traps to learning about daily life in the tunnels, every part of the tour was fascinating. There’s even a shooting range where you can try out different rifles—another unique experience that adds to the adventure.

Overall, visiting the Cu Chi Tunnels was both humbling and exciting. If you ever find yourself in Vietnam, this is an absolute must-see. A guided tour helps you understand the rich history behind the site, and taking your time to explore it makes the visit even more memorable."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"I've been here several times, as a kid and as a grown up. It's a great place to take friends from out of town for a quick day trip. I'd not recommend eating at the restaurant there though, bland food at a high price."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,Good for a day trip. The guides are friendly and speak good english.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Must visit to see the historic part of the Vietnam war. Weekends it gets very crowded.  Well organized including wash room , lunch place and experience. Did a short tunnel crawl. Firing range is another experience one can have and bullets casing can be taken as souvenirs. However beware they are not allowed on flights so courier them to yourself from HCMC post office if you want to keep them"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,This experience as part of a tour I booked was amazing. The history of the location and the surreal experience of going in the tunnel was a challenging but amazing unique thing to do. 125k for a ticket which is not too bad. Would recommend visiting here to understand the history of here.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"If you are visiting Ho Chi Minh, it is must to visit Chu Chi Tunnels. Our guide Mr Daniel is very friendly and knowledgeable. He has shared a detailed history of Vietnam and the Chu Chi Tunnels. We really enjoyed our experience during this tour. Thank you Mr Daniel and our kind driver."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Worth a visit with a guide for historical understanding of the Vietnam war and how the Viet Cong frustrated the Western forces with their tunnels,"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Join one day tour going to Cu Chi Tunnel, very exciting and fun. The guide tell the story about vietnam so good, i can see many traps here and try to enter the tunnel, really fun! Try tapioca roots at the end the tunnel. This place also sell souvenirs."
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,The place was very good. And it was a pleasant bus ride there. Highly recommend if u r going to visit vietnam
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Thung gave us an absolutely outstanding tour! We were probably lucky because it’s the off-season, so it ended up being just the two of us - a very personal experience. The tour was incredibly interesting and informative; Thung took a lot of time to explain everything in detail. It’s truly moving to gain such an insightful glimpse into this part of history. The tunnels are quite narrow, but there’s the option to go through only a short section if you prefer. The shooting range experience was also great. Many thanks to Thung for such a memorable tour!"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Visiting the Cu Chi Tunnels is a must for anyone interested in history and culture. The site offers a deep dive into Vietnam’s resilience and ingenuity during the war. The guided tour was incredibly informative, with detailed explanations of the tunnel system, its significance, and the challenges faced by those who lived and fought there.

Walking through the narrow tunnels was an eye-opening experience, giving a glimpse of what life must have been like underground. The interactive exhibits, including the chance to see hidden trapdoors and sample traditional food, added to the immersive experience.

The grounds are well-maintained, and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The shooting range is an optional activity for those looking for a unique thrill. However, be prepared for some areas to feel crowded during peak hours.

Overall, this is a powerful and thought-provoking visit that provides a deeper appreciation for history. Highly recommend adding this to your Vietnam itinerary!"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"The Cu Chi Tunnels are a truly extraordinary site, a testament to the resilience and ingenuity of the Vietnamese people during the Vietnam War. Stepping into this network of underground passages is like stepping back in time, offering a visceral understanding of the conditions endured by those who lived and fought within them.

The tunnels themselves are a marvel of engineering. The multi-layered design, the ingenious ventilation systems, and the hidden trapdoors all speak to the strategic brilliance of the Viet Cong. Walking (or crawling) through a section of the tunnels provides a profound sense of the claustrophobia and hardship faced by the soldiers. The sheer scale of the network, stretching for hundreds of kilometers, is staggering.
The displays of booby traps and weaponry, while sobering, offer a crucial glimpse into the realities of guerrilla warfare. They highlight the resourcefulness of the Viet Cong in utilizing limited resources to defend their territory. Learning about the hospitals, kitchens, and command centers within the tunnels underscores the remarkable self-sufficiency and determination of those who lived and operated underground.
The Cu Chi Tunnels are not just a historical site; they are a powerful symbol of the human spirit's ability to adapt and overcome. They provide a unique and unforgettable experience, offering a tangible connection to a pivotal period in history. If you want to understand the Vietnam War from a different perspective, this is a must-see. The raw experience of the tunnels themselves is powerful enough to make this a five star experience"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"A good lesson.

Bugs repellent is needed but sunscreen isn’t: the area is heavily shaded.

The ground is not completely even but a few mates with walking sticks are fine.

There are opportunities to going into the tunnel, experiencing what it was like, in much better condition. It took us little more than two hours to return to bus, this included short break when a few mates want to do the shooting AK47.

…
Peace"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,This is a tunnel structure made by Vietnamese to hide from the enemies. This is something to look for and that's why it's knows as a tourist attraction. Tourists can explore this alone but a guided tour is recommended as it is hassle free and the tour agent arrange everything. They allow you to go underground and feel the realistical experience with these tunnels. The tunnel tour goes for a minimum of 1 hour. Good one if you are visiting Ho Chi Minh City.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,We had a blast exploring the tunnels! Super cool and interesting experience.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,Excellent tour of the tunnels with a very knowledgeable guide. Great history of Vietnam.
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"I visited Cu Chi Tunnels during Tet and I was surprised that it was one of a few places that worked these days. Moreover, the place wasn't crowded at all. Price without a tour is 120k with guide included. So it's really worth visiting"
ChIJKXVC7sAyCzERLxR747WgrZg,"Very impressed with how organized this tourist area is! Thousands of tourists daily but each group was led by experienced guides who made it so we never had to wait to see any of the many super interesting stopping points in this area.

The history of this place was also very interesting to learn about. You can tell they really care about sharing their history.

I recommend arriving by water which is what we did. The speedboat experience along the Saigon river to get to Cu Chi was also really great"
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"You don’t really have to buy your tickets in advance. Maybe on a weekend? I’m not sure. The collections in the museum are amazing. Just prepare your tissue, and yourself because you’ll get angry and teary at the same time.

It’s not hot inside, and there’s an elevator for people with disabilities, elderly, or pregnant woman.

If you really want to immerse yourself in here, and read everything. Allot at least 3-4 hours."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"The War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City offers a powerful and thought-provoking experience that dives deep into Vietnam's wartime history, particularly the Vietnam War. From the moment you enter, you're met with striking exhibits outside displays include American helicopters, tanks, and bombshells that set the tone before stepping inside.

The museum’s galleries are well-curated, showcasing raw and emotional photography, first-hand accounts, weapon displays, and reconstructed prison conditions. One of the most impactful sections focuses on the long-term effects of chemical warfare, especially Agent Orange, with sobering imagery and survivor stories.

The prison exhibit with life-sized mannequins and a preserved guillotine is chilling and historically significant.

There’s also dedicated space exploring global support during the war, along with detailed panels about Da Lat and Phu Quoc prisons. The layout encourages reflection and personal interpretation, rather than forcing a political stance.

You’ll want to spend at least 1~2 hours here to take in the emotional weight and historical context fully. It's not a light visit, but it's an essential one for anyone wanting to understand Vietnam’s past from a Vietnamese perspective.

Respectful dress and quiet observation are appreciated in there.

ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Visiting the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City was one of the most powerful and emotional experiences of my trip to Vietnam. I went in expecting to learn about history, but I left with something much deeper: a profound reflection on humanity, suffering, and resilience.
The exhibits—especially the photographs—were deeply moving. Some images were so raw and disturbing that I almost cried while walking through the galleries. I found myself needing to pause and take time to process what I was seeing. The human cost of the Vietnam War, especially for civilians, was heartbreaking.

What struck me most was how personal the museum felt. It doesn’t just present facts or military artifacts; it shows the faces, names, and lives of people affected—both Vietnamese and foreign. The section on Agent Orange and its lingering effects across generations was particularly difficult to take in.

I left with a heavy heart but also with a greater understanding of Vietnam’s past and an even stronger appreciation for the strength and kindness of its people today. Despite everything the country endured, I was met everywhere with warmth and openness. This visit changed the way I think about war, history, and reconciliation.

If you're in Ho Chi Minh City, I believe this museum is a must-visit. It’s not easy, but it’s important."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Amazing little museum. 3 floors of information pertaining to the Vietnam war and it’s lasting effects. In particular, I found the “War Photographers” section to be captivating…a lot of stories in there about journalists all over the globe that were intent on capturing the war and the brutality therein, often times paying the ultimate price for their attempts to broadcast the truth. The entire museum could easily take 2-4 hours if you’re intent on reading all the descriptions (provided in Vietnamese and English).

One small note - I didn’t see any warnings, but some of the content in here can definitely be unsettling. I’m glad they haven’t shied away from this, as it’s important to show the horrible effects of the war directly. But there are quite a lot of pictures of dead and mutilated bodies, especially within the “War Crimes” room. Also, there’s a large section dedicated to the health ramifications of Agent Orange, showing the deformities (in both children and adults, Vietnamese and foreign) and mental conditions caused by that horrible chemical. I saw a lot of families with young kids in here, and a lot of the children had slightly terrified looks on their faces. I assume if it was affecting to me, it may have been doubly so for them. Again, I recommend coming and not turning your face away from the horrible facts and effects of the war, but if you’re sensitive or have young children who may not be mentally prepared for such imagery, you may want to avoid certain exhibits that you feel could include such photographs (mainly War Crimes and Agent Orange are the two areas that are disturbing, I haven’t included any pictures from them below).

If you’re in Saigon even a little bit interested in the history and lasting effects of the war, this is a must-visit museum. I visited on a Saturday afternoon and it was crowded, but still easy to see everything."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,Very busy. Good layout. Clean. Well airconditioned. Friendly and helpful staff. Very reasonable entrance fee. It serves as a reminder of how horrid humanity can be. Let us never forget.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"BEWARE of Coconut saler around this area! There are many of them on every corner.
We visited the museum on Monday the 1st of Sept before Vietnam 80th National Day so the museum was way too packed! The building has 3 levels consist of 7 rooms of war history timeline, consequences, and what's happening now. Some of the contents can be very scary especially the photos captured during the war.
The ground floor outside has the replica of jail (Tiger Cages) and torture chamber used by the Vietnamese government to deal with local rebellious. Many army tanks, planes and transport were displayed in front of the building.
Definitely interesting to see the war history from the perspective of Vietnamese at this museum."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"The War Remnants Museum is all an educational museum that teaches you about history- how Vietnam were involved in the WW2 and how it has impacted Vietnam until to date where the Agent Orange still hurt descendants of the victims. The war weapons, guns, pistols, machine guns, and even helicopters, fighter jets and tanks are grand and overpowering. I wish there is world peace and no more war, humans should stand together and embrace their short term on Earth! Cheers and World Peace ✌🏼 ☮️"
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Very sad and confronting.  We really took our time to look at everything.  The more and more we read it was a little disheartening.  War is never a great thing but unfortunately this museum is very one sided. They don't tell the whole truth. In one way I understand why they say USA invaded but for the South this was not true. The USA and Australians and other countries came to help the South but this is never mentioned. Even speaking to locals about this they agree and a very passionate about how one sided it is. I still recommend this place highly but have your own view on this. Apart from that, the photos are always etched in my mind."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"The place is truly heart breaking to see how much the Vietnamese people have  suffered from this tragic war. You get to learn all about the history of the war and explanations about everything that occurred there and even see real equipment from the war that was left behind by the Americans like planes,  tanks, bombs, weapons, gas masks, etc."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Was a great museum full of relics and monuments to a whole lot. The floors are dedicated to different “eras” or tragedies of the war. Which were of course depressing to read about, but very important to understand and learn from. The staff were also very helpful and there was a virtual tour (headphones) to help"
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"My favourite place in Ho Chi Minh city.

An outside area with military equipment from the US army, but the most impressive is on the inside. Different rooms with different parts of the Vietnam war, specially one dedicated to war photographers.

The only ""con"" is that the story is a bit biased, but considering all the other museums in the world are biased towards the US, it's refreshing to see what actions they did during the Vietnam war."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"First time my daughter visited  War Museum.  she was truly amazed. The powerful displays, old photographs, and real war artifacts left her speechless. The place wasn't crowded at all. Ground floor did't have any AC but 1st and 2nd floor had AC.  Staff was helpful at the gate."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"A great museum at District 3 HCMC. I learned a lot throughout my visit. Some of the room looks new and all the room maintained so well. However, the staff on the gate were kinda rude to us. Maybe they should spoke in a more polite manner to their customer."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"A powerful and deeply moving experience. The War Remnants Museum doesn’t hold back, the exhibits are raw, honest, and heartbreaking. It’s not an easy visit, but an important one. The photos and stories confront you with the brutal realities of war, and they stay with you long after you leave. If you’re in Ho Chi Minh City, this museum is a must both to honor the victims and to reflect on history."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,Very intriguing and informative experience. Those exhibitions taught me a lot about what happened in Vietnam and what it has undergone. The whole tour of the museum take around 2-3 hours (I read most of the signs). The ticket was very affordable as well.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"War Remnants Museum – A Powerful and Eye-Opening Experience

As a family of four, our visit to the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City was both powerful and educational. The museum presents the Vietnam War from a Vietnamese perspective, offering insights and stories that challenged our previous understanding and encouraged meaningful reflection.

The exhibits are thoughtfully curated, with impactful photography, preserved war artifacts, and deeply personal accounts that humanize the tragedy of war. Walking through the displays, we learned a great deal—not just about the history and events, but about the ideology and perspective of a country that lived through immense suffering and resilience.

Some sections are difficult to take in, especially for younger visitors, but they sparked important conversations for our family. We left with a deeper understanding of Vietnam’s history and a strong appreciation for the value of peace and empathy.

This is not just a museum visit—it’s an experience that stays with you. Highly recommended for families seeking a deeper, more global perspective on history."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"A fascinating and deeply moving place. I've seen some people saying this is a very one sided establishment, but I'm sure that an American version of this tragic war will lean towards the legitamacy of American involvement.

As someone who is neither Vietnamese or American, I took away from this more than anything a message about the futility of war.

And unfortunately, mankind's unfathomable and unending creativity when it comes to hurting and torturing others.

Did the American's commit horrific war crimes? Undoubtedly. Both sides did and unfortunately mankind has not learnt their lesson as can be seen around the world right now.

A couple of side notes, there were a number of young children present. This was not a child friendly space, due to the brutal reality of the war being present throughout the museum.

Also, much as I felt when I visited the Twin Towers 9/11 museum, having a gift shop in such a place is in very poor taste."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Very sad, but really important to visit to get a good idea of what the Americans did in Vietnam. Also gives you a good idea of what they’re doing in Palestine right now through their proxy Israel.

PS heavy rain the day we went."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"No wait, and no need to buy tickets. Incredible moving place. I took my children, and some areas needed “pre-screening” beforehand. They loved the tanks and planes outside though.
The exhibits were really thought provoking, and good to see the perspectives of the war from a “non western” angle."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"The War Remnants Museum is an absolute must‑visit in Ho Chi Minh City. The exhibits are powerful and deeply moving, offering an honest look at history that really makes you stop and think. The displays are well‑curated, and the photos and artifacts tell the story in a way that’s both educational and emotional. A truly unforgettable experience – highly recommended for anyone visiting the city."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Visited this museum as part of my paid tour itinerary (became a solo tour coz other person did not show up 🤷‍♂️). I paid a few ten thousand VND for the entrance ticket. At the entrance, some of the weapons and platforms such as warplanes, tanks, helicopters, artillery pcs, left behind by the US Army, and subsequently captured by then North Vietnam troops are displayed. Inside are more photos and other war related items on display, too.

This visit has provided me a brief but impactful overview on the Vietnamese people's perspective (which is being highlighted by their current govt) regarding this dark part of their history. It also has artefacts related to the war, thus providing better visualization of what weapons and machines were used during that time. I managed to go through most, if not all of the exhibits w/in a few hours. A recommended place to visit in the city especially for those who are interested in world history, wars."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,I was not expecting to like so much this museum. Maybe because I felt I had so much to learn as a human being by reading all that happened in Vietnam and that in my country very little information arrived about it. The section about the orange agent is a hard part to swallow. I got shocked on how so many lifes were affected and still are by a chemical used in the war. Going to Ho Chi Minh and missing this place is not understanding a big part of the countries’ history and not understanding Vietnam in a whole. I am so grateful to have gone and would go again to be able to learn more about it.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,An amazing museum experience and I thoroughly recommend going here when in HCM. There is a large amount of exhibits and some are very confronting/moving; definitely a good way to see the Vietnam war from not a western perspective.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,The best place to visit in Saigon. You'll see how Vietnam and the US fought the war. Every minute detail of the war is being shown in the museum. I think it's such a great place to visit if you're interested in the history of Vietnam or you love reading about the world politics or international relations.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"We happened to visit the War Remnants museum on the 50th anniversary of reunification. So it was a huge day in Vietnam marking 50 years since the end of the war. The museum was only 80,000 Dong each (~£2.30) to get in. We felt this was amazing value.
Before entering me and my girlfriend had no knowledge about the Vietnam war. However exiting 3 hours later we felt as thought we knew a lot. Inside the museum you can read the full timeline of the war. It’s quite distressing seeing what the Americans did and many people were quite emotional. There are photos which are very disturbing and show the extent of the pain the Vietnamese went through.
Outside the building there were military vehicles and weapons which were fascinating to look at.
Overall really glad we went and it has given us a real insight to the horrors that occurred.
This really is a must if you are visiting Ho Chi Minh City."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"A visit to the War Remnants Museum was very interesting and worthwhile.
The old machinery left by the US Army has been kept in very good order.
I was a child in South Australia, when the protest movement really moved things along, particularly at the universities. There were some old news paper clips of some of the Australian protests around, along with other countries also protesting the Vietnam war."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,Didn't take many pictures inside but it was truly a worthwhile visit with lots of things to learn from this very tragic event in history. Also shows how cruel human beings can be! 😞I guess the saddest part is to know that recent events happening in the world have shown that mankind still hasn't learnt from our past mistakes.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Eye opening experience. Vibe was heavy as the museum highlights the harsh outcomes of war and the toll it takes on humanity. A lot of graphic images, war artifacts on exhibit. A must go when in Saigon to learn about its troubled and bloody history. I had a very educational and humbling experience. Definitely worth my time.

There is a short flight of stairs to enter the main museum, once inside, there is an elevator which is convenient for those with wheelchairs and kid strollers."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"A real eye opener on the Vietnam war and the utter devastation caused by agent orange, hundreds if not thousands of artefacts on display including types of explosives, weaponry and military vehicles. Informative, interesting, heart breaking and much more, I truly recommend this as a cant miss stop on your trip."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"The Museum is easily accessible from central areas such as District 1 by motorbike, taxi, or bus. Opening hours are from 7:30 AM to 5:30 PM (ticket counter closes at 5:00 PM). The standard entrance fee is 40,000 VND; children aged 6–15, students, seniors, people with meritorious service, and those from remote areas receive a 50% discount; children under 6 enter free. The museum consists of an outdoor display area and a three-story exhibition building with about 4,522 m² of indoor space, plus over 3,000 m² outdoors. At the front yard and outdoor grounds, visitors can see military equipment such as the M48 Patton tank, UH-1 “Huey” helicopter, F-5 fighter jet, A-1 Skyraider aircraft, and various bombs, along with artifacts like the reconstructed “tiger cages” used to detain political prisoners, a guillotine, and victim statues, offering clear representations of wartime conditions.

Inside, the ground floor introduces the theme “The World Supports Vietnam in the Anti-American War” with more than 100 photos and 145 documents. The first floor focuses on “War Crimes” and “Consequences of Agent Orange” through images, artifacts, and documents. The second floor includes exhibitions such as “Historical Truth,” “Vietnam — War and Peace,” “Memoirs,” and war photography by Japanese and international correspondents. Displays feature captions in Vietnamese, English, and Japanese. The museum does not have a dedicated parking lot; visitors can park motorbikes at nearby spots a few meters from the entrance, with fees around 4,000–5,000 VND. The indoor space is kept clean and organized by exhibition theme."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Powerful and somber, the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City offers a stark look at the Vietnam War through photos and artifacts. A must-visit for history buffs, though emotionally intense. Highly recommend."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Incredibly cheap to get in. No need to prebook.
Excellent museum with all the old US army vehicles, planes etc.
well worth a visit.
Has a cafe and shop."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Typically when I visit a museum in America I'm both enlightened and uplifted - not the later case here in Vietnam😑. Horror. Dread. Empathy. Remorse? The images are too graphic to post. But if you've ever fought in war, heard stories from family members who have, or have been associated in any way with the destruction that wars cause, then well... you get the picture. As an American it's unsettling but at the same time unifying to share the experience with people from all different countries (and perspectives), including Vietnamese. If you're not emotionally moved after visiting then I can't imagine you're human."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Place full of history about the vietnam war, a really deep and raw insight to the country's history as well as the story of the people that lived through the war. The exhibits on the upper levels were what made the visit memorable with all the stories about the survivors of agent orange, the prisoners kept in the harsh living conditions and many more."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"A must-see! If there is one thing you do in Ho Chi Minh, it has to get the war remnants museum.  While it is interesting seeing the war machines, planes, choppers, tanks, artillery, etc. It's when you get inside that the photographs, descriptions, and facts that you must read describe the events during the war is truly awakening. Discretion is advised as some images are horrifying and had me emotionally moved that I needed time for reflection."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Learnt a lot about the History of Vietnam 🇻🇳 especially the war with America. It's really a sad story which happened 50 years ago. There is display of American Armoury, weapons,Tanks,Fighters etc. It's over two floors of History. I admire the present Vietnamese generation. They are all smiles and  go out of their way to help you. Saigon can be very challenging and frustrating with the traffic jams. Always plan ahead."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Very good place to inform yourself of the atrocities done during the Vietnam War. It’s one of the living testaments as to why these things should never happen again. Glad I could see eye-to-eye detailed first-hand accounts and pictures regarding the war, and definitely learned a lot from the visit."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Visiting the War Remnants Museum is a powerful and emotional experience that really stays with you. It's one of those places that gives you a deeper understanding of history in a way that books or documentaries sometimes can't. The museum focuses heavily on the Vietnam War, especially from the perspective of the Vietnamese people, and it doesn’t shy away from showing the impact of the conflict.

The exhibits are very well put together, with a mix of photographs, personal stories, official documents, and military equipment. Some sections, like the one about Agent Orange and the aftereffects of chemical warfare, are heartbreaking and hard to look at, but they are incredibly important. It’s not always an easy visit emotionally, but that’s part of what makes it so meaningful.
Outside, there’s a display of tanks, helicopters, and fighter planes, which adds to the scale and reality of what happened. Inside, you move through rooms that tell different parts of the story, from the roots of the war to the protests around the world and the aftermath that’s still felt today.

The museum isn’t about taking sides. It’s about remembering the human cost of war and learning from the past. It's also a reminder of how resilient people can be. I really appreciated how respectful and thoughtful the space felt, and how it encourages reflection rather than judgment.

If you're in Ho Chi Minh City, this museum is a must-visit. It’s not just about history, it’s about empathy and understanding. Give yourself time to take it all in. It’s not something you’ll want to rush."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"This museum is more than just a record of history — it carries the deep pain and sorrow of humanity. Once inside, I felt the preciousness of human life and the profound wounds caused by war. The museum serves as a powerful reminder that we must strive for peace in the world."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,A powerful and well-curated glimpse into Vietnam's history. The preserved war remnants tell compelling stories—both haunting and inspiring. A must-visit for anyone wanting to reflect on the past and appreciate the sacrifices that shaped the present.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"It was an interesting trip down to memory lane, added learning to understand the history and culture of Vietnam. Definitely add it to your bucket list if you’re visiting Ho Chi Minh."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,Visiting war remnants museum in ho chi Minh City was informative as well as emotional experience. We saw the what war could do to the people. How tough and resilient local people were against americans.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"You would never even guess the amount of atrocities the Americans committed in VIetnam. This is the place where this has been documented, with evidence and photographs. Extensive collection on the use of Agent Orange as well. Takes 1-2 hours to finish if you look at all floors. Independent photographers collection is amazing."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Museum on the History of the Vietnam War. Numerous exhibits in the outdoor area as well as within the building. On the left side you can see how the prisoners were treated. In the middle part of the exhibition, numerous photos can be seen showing the horrors of war and the suffering of the various people. Certainly not everything is suitable for children. All in all, a very objective account of the Vietnam conflict shows what war means for the affected people, no matter which side."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,Heart wrenching stories of the Vietnam war. I would suggest people to go to second floor and start from the room 1. We went from ground floor and it’s not the correct way. You will surely cry when you come out of the rooms. I wish no more wars in the world. Everyone deserves to live the life the like.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"A very good must see museum from the (North) Vietnamese view of the war, however it is extremely confronting and there is no way to describe the sheer scale of the battle lines and the horrific trauma on all Vietnamese peoples during this time. Overall I would suggest visiting as it doesn’t sanitise and gives an appreciation of how terrible warfare is."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"The museum brings home the suffering that regular civilians endured during the conflict.

The atrocities committed, the wide spread use of chemicals against a poor population and the enduring suffering for so many people years after the fighting ended, highlights the futility and pointlessness of the war."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Definitly a place i would recommand to unterstand more about the history of the country, even if you are not a history nut. No need to book a ticket before, its 40k VND per person, we waited 5min in the queue at 12am"
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Tourists must come here to closely understand and emphasize with Vietnamese people & their history and the pain they have gone through, colonial crimes & war crimes been passed generation to generation and treated like experimental rats by Americans. This place very well articulates the pain of the gone and the ones who are just surviving through the Agent Orange."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Best museum in HCMC if you want to understand more about Viet Nam War and how miserable people was during the war time. As our family has senior member used to serve military on the opposite site, this museum brought back long lasting memories, how and why the equipment been used for what purpose, remind us that war is not glory but pains for both sides, that we should not seek for war but must always prepare for it.

Of course propaganda is an usual thing you will see in museum like this. But I admit that if you already watched documentaries about Viet Nam war, or part of it, you will be satisfied with your subjectivity. Ticket is cheap (1.5USD), I want to pay more so they could expand the sites and more room to display."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"A must see place to visit. Very touching!
Many images and objects related to the Vietnam wars and its lasting impacts (dioxin poisoning..). Some images may be difficult for young children. I recommend it for ages 10 and up."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"The entrance is only 40K pp and it’s totally worth it. I imagine that the best way to do explore it would be from the third/second floor and going down, once the higher floor is about the earlier history of the country and the middle floor is much more dense about the war crimes. In my opinion this place is a must visit if you ever come to HCMC because it tells in so many details about the war and its history. Besides that, for all the westerns it’s an opportunity to get some knowledge besides that spread and teach in schools. I must say it’s a very dense visiting. I spent about 3h and wasn’t able to read everything"
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"War Remnants museum is reminding us of the war days of Vietnam against the US.There is a great peace of exhibition i.e tank,missiles and plenty of pictures are put in us in those days and we feel pride How Vietnamese are resilient .A must visit this historical monument."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Certainly worth the visit. It gives you a real and raw perspective on the Vietnam War. Included in the exhibition is a section capturing photos of the carnage of the War including the Pultizer prize winning shot of the Vietnamese girl burned when the US napalm bombed Vietnam.

It was sobering and yet so important for any tourist to understand the impact of War on innocent lives! This year was the 50th year of the end of the the War!"
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Moving and inspiring giving the current Vietnam. My respect and admiration for the people Vietnam has increased even more, even though it was pretty high already."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,What happened during this war is heartbreaking. Learning more about it gives you such an insight to how hard Vietnamese people fought for freedom. A trip to the Chu Chi Tunnels is a must too.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Lots of very interesting artefacts and exhibitions. Definitely worth visiting, however it does get pretty crowded. Found it hard to really absorb all the information due to the chaos of people around. Certainly not your typical ""museum"" atmosphere, but would still highly recommend.
There was a huge line for tickets stretching around the block, however I went with part of a private city tour and skipped the line entirely. Highly recommended doing it that way over just rocking up on a whim. As mentioned above, it was difficult to actually stand and read all the info, so having a private guide was certainly worth it!"
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,There is lots of pictures to look and weapon plus ammunition the one thing this place needs or that others usually have is a Thanks section where there give thanks or recognise the help form other countries eg ANZAC they only show enemies.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"A must do in HCMC, learned a lot about the Vietnam War, be aware that some photos hurts, I was not ready for that but you have to visit ! For the history…"
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Recommended. Nice exposition of aircrafts, tanks, helicopters, weapons. Very illustrative museum, with plenty of information.
Good to learn about Vietnam war, but remember that war museums always shows one part of the history, the coin has always 2 sides 🤓"
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,Exceptional collections of remnants/ memorabilia.  Gives one the true story of the war and not just the Americanized version that is so well known. Makes one appreciate the struggles of the Vietnamese and the hard won freedom.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Impressive and shocking museum ever I visited before. There are plenty of things that you can learn about the history of Vietnam on 20 Century. We didn’t expect this kind of museum. But it was really impressive and helpful to understand and learn about the misery of war and suppress of people. But you need to prepare your children to encounter exhibits. The exhibition is fact and part of history but it is too violent for kids. My daughter was frightened and crying when she met some pictures. If I knew that, I would prepare it."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,Wow. A fascinating and emotional experience highlighting the atrocities of the Vietnam War. Very informative and organised. There are some distressing moments. But an absolute must visit when in Ho Chi Minh.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Visited here. Word of warning ⚠️ It can be quite a harrowing visit, especially the Agent Orange effects exhibition. Despite that, it's quite an enlightening experience. Recommended but have at least 3 hrs.free to do it justice."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Definitely worth visiting when you visit HCM. Usually, you can get the tickets online, but we are able to get it at the Venue without any complications."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Very reasonable entrance fee, amazing exposition of US military equipment from 60's and lots of stories to hear out."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Remember to go to every floor. Amazing museum, and the history tells you a lot about the suffering that the Vietnamese faced during the Vietnam War. Stop War!!"
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Lots of really interesting stuff here. Add some buffer to however much time you plan on spending here, especially if you're into this kinda thing. Coffee onsite that you can bring into the museum which I appreciated given the heat."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,Very interesting museum with a lot of thought provoking moments throughout. Definitely a must visit if in Ho Chi Minh. I arrived early but when I was leaving there was a very large queue so advise would be to go early
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Before coming here, I thought i knew everything i needed to know about the  Vietnam war. I knew there were war crimes comitted but i never really understood the gravity of the situation until my recent visit. It was heavy and heart wrenching going through the well documented American atrocities on the civilian population, especially on the children looking severely frightened as they are held by their elderly grandmother moments before they were murdered in cold blood. Nothing can prepare you emotionally seeing photos of lifeless infants, stiff, bloodied and riddled with gunshots lying on the street. What did he do? You keep asking yourself.

Yet you can't help reflect why humanity never learns. I still think about it alot, especially at this time when the same is being done on the Children of Gaza. We just stood, watched, and cry about it in a future museum somewhere to serve as a reminder. Yet the reminder was simply just a reminder, not a lesson to learn from."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Amazing big museum about the VN war with US army. How they Vietcong destroy the stupid US army, which never win a war in history 😂 poor USA 👍🏻
Using Agent orange and destroyed lot of nature"
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,Very interesting museum. It was very detailed and full on. Many pictures and stories were shared and displayed. It’s not for the light hearted. I needed something to cheer me up afterwards. So many awful stories what the Vietnamese had to live through
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,It was exceptionally busy as we happened to go there on Independence day. It showcases an incredible amount of information. You do need to be cautious if you are sensitive to explicit scenes of suffering.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,This was well worth the money ($40k) to visit. You can use your credit card to pay separately from the ticket dispenser next to the cashier. You learn about their war history especially agent orange - very sad. Might be a little too graphic for the younger audiences.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,A really insightful place to visit and an important part of Vietnams history displayed. Wouldn’t recommend the 2nd and 3rd floors for children due to distressing images.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,Worth a visit to see full exhibit of the Vietnam War. Some parts have very brutal pictures of death and destruction.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"I was overwhelmed for the better part of 4 hours. I immersed myself in all the history presented in these carefully catered exhibitions, and allowed myself to feel everything that arose, even the guilt for my ignorance and oblivion to some of the biggest atrocities ever played out in history.

It's fascinating how, in our little comfortable white previlege bubble, we so easily consume any information we are presented with and even make entertainment out of it (i.e Hollywood movies), mindlessly gorging on biased content, creating dualistic views of the world.

Yet, when I see some of us coming into a place like this, realising they come from a country (to no fault of their own) that was the true perpetrator, and getting overwhelmed with pain and shame, thus having to leave the place ""because they can't handle it"", is a notorious reflection of how society has come to be.

When you come into a place like this, the minimum you can do is allow yourself to feel the pain, to suffer, to cry, to be uncomfortable, to sit with all the emotions and reflect. We all owe it to these people, the unmeasurable human pain and suffering that took place not so long ago, from which impacts are still affecting current generations.

Whatever you may feel in there, will not amount to a sliver of the smallest amount of pain lived by these brave people, these fighters. So stay, respect the place, read, take your time, and FEEL. It's the only gesture you can make that truly can make a difference because the only way to change repeating history is by moving our hearts."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"you MUST pay the extra for the recorded guide headset, it changes everything for your understanding of what truly happened, Very sobering, to see the atrocities committed."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,The place is quite unique and especially if you are into understanding the origins of modern Vietnam this is the best place. It accurately depicts the reasons and more importantly the depth of impact of the war. It takes you on an incredible journey of their history and how they fought for their freedom. Please take around 2 to 3 hours to enjoy the entire journey.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Well worth a visit. This was a big event in the history of the country. And if you think it only finished 50 years ago! I’ve grown up only knowing one side of the story, but as usual there are two sides. There’s an interesting article about an American senator that served in Vietnam. Ive added some photos for interest. There’s a large indoors exhibition. The tiger cages were not what I was expecting."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,I would definitely recommend..it's a hard read and watch but it gives you a no holds bard of what actually happened during the war...
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Heartbreaking !!! Every American should visit this place to understand what kind of war crimes they committed. I will share the ""light"" pictures, when you see the hard once you will be shocked !"
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"War Remnants Museum, Saigon

A very impressive and moving museum. The exhibits on war crimes and the devastating impact of Agent Orange are especially powerful and painful to see. It's a difficult but important reminder of the human cost of war. Everyone should visit this place to understand history better. Sadly, it also makes you reflect on how little humanity seems to learn from the past."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"My experience at the war remnants museum was extremely emotional. Sometimes I felt like looking away from the depressing photos but still made myself look as the experiences and events the people have gone through is not to be forgotten.
In the left side in the front of the museum there is a small place which shows the cages and torture methods that were inflicted on the people imprisoned. I would really recommend to look for it as it is easy to miss."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,Very sad and enlightening. I would not recommend it for young children unless they are prepared and accompanied by an adult.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,The vietnam war is a horrific part of human history and the museum does a fantastic job of being that to light. Ir is quite graphic and confronting but to show was happened in the war it is necessary.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"This was a fantastic museum with lots of rooms to explore telling the story of the Vietnam war , very anti American. I was hoping it would tell the story of how the war began to set the scene to the exhibits but well worth a visit - very sad !"
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"If you want to learn about this tragic war, this is the spot! Very nice museum in the center of downtown. Outdoor and indoor exhibits with a decent shop for gifts. I was there with friends who are locals, have to admit some parts were very emotional. Makes you appreciate the fact I have never had to experience such a war in my lifetime."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"I was horrified by what I learned today.  I only knew that America sent 19 year old to Vietnam to fight, and the Americans were up in arms today.  Learning about he absolute horror of the atrocities inflicted on the civilians, the shocking way men,women, and children were gunned down in cold blood and the pain and suffering from napalm bombs, was absolutely sickening.  I went to Auschwitz not long ago, and i truly believe Vietnam was the American's Auschwitz.   I truly hope that those who carried out those  war crimes were held accountable and made to pay.
The only good thing today, was the art gallery with the children's paintings about soldiers. My 11 year old Grephew said, ""The pictures have a lot of meaning."""
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Great activity for a great price. Horrifying to see how bad the war really was. Great learning experience. If you’re in ho chi minh, you must go"
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Heartbreaking yet beautiful❤️‍🩹📜❤️ Remember to donate money to Agent Orange if you get the chance🕊🇻🇳

(Very smooth self service ticket machine, we went on a cloudy monday. Big museum with many different segments. AC/fan in every  closed space.)"
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,Easy to purchase entry tickets. Enjoyed the history of the Vietnam War. I feel the presentations and sharing are raw (alot of reading expected).
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"It is a really cool place. I will admit it nearly brought me to tears. The price is fair. And there is so mucho see. My favourite was all the tanks and planes. And the huge array of weapons on display.

Get ready for some serious truths about the war. And the struggle of the people.  Sad but a must see"
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,Must visit place in Hoh Chi Min city.. its a treasure of information regarding the war fought in vietnam.. it shows the photos of the struggle of the Vietnamese people during the war period... outside the collection of fighter jets and tanks with varieties of helicopters used by US during the war period....
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Went there in the morning and was already quite busy. The place looks well maintained, nice set up and we decided to rent the headset guided ""tour"". The only issue (just my opinion) is that all was a bit chaotic, bit difficult to find the right storyline, which is rather important. Nevertheless, all what was displayed was interesting, some images were pretty shocking but it is showing the brutal reality on what happened during, but eventually important, also what happened after the war.
The visit is anywhere between 1 to 3 hours, depending on how deep you want to go.
Definitely recommend visiting the place when in HCMC."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"A very interesting museum with plenty of information, photos, and artifacts about the Vietnam War and its aftermath. A big plus: all texts are also available in English, making it easy to follow along. The exhibition feels factual and not propagandistic, allowing for a thoughtful engagement with the subject. A powerful and thought-provoking place: highly recommended for anyone interested in history."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Primarily about the American atrocities from the Vietnamese side. There is always 2 sides to a story as you will see if you go to the Cu Chi tunnels. There are a few military exhibitions but primarily, it is photographs and stories.  Not expensive to go in so well worth a visit. Saw someone visibly moved to tears, so be prepared."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,Very good museum to visit and learn about the war and history. Some very disturbing images.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,Great and touristic place by all means. I have to say that I felt pain in my heart when I visited the museum. Can’t believe how those people suffered to get their independence.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,A great place to know about the history of US invasion in Vietnam.Hope a peaceful world
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Another reminder of the evils of war & human conflict. Nothing like unleashing the dogs of war to reveal the depravities of human nature.
The museum is well done in terms of the exhibits. Much thought and energy has gone into preserving the memories and highlighting the lessons learned. The public forgets easily."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,It shows all the stuff that went on in the Vietnam war kind of sad but very informative very knowledgeable. Glad I went.
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,"Oh my gosh this museum shook me to the core! Very painful yet very real — it shows the incalculable cost of the Vietnam War, of any war. Visiting this museum is something that everyone must experience to deepen their understanding of humanity."
ChIJzwg3ojAvdTERqnQUK99K2Xw,Great place knowledge and history about wars and must try cu chi tunnels and fire sone ak 47 and machine guns
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Beautifully designed. Kept up in great shape. You can see the entire palace, all the rooms and their functions, and everything very well explained. It tells the story of a very interesting time of Vietnam's history."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Visiting the Independence Palace was a  fascinating experience. Walking through the historic halls and rooms, I could really imagine about the important events that took place there.  Addtional, i used to use the audio guide that was a really helpful experience. It gave me clear and detailed explanations, so I could understand the history and meaning behind them. The instructions were easy to follow, It felt like having a personal tour guide with me, and it made the visit more interesting and meaningful."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"The Independence Palace is worth a quick visit for its history and architecture, but honestly I don’t think the audio guide is worth buying. There are already plenty of signs and information around, so you can still understand the place without it.

It’s definitely a spot filled with history, and you get a sense of the important events that happened here. A good stop if you’re exploring District 1, but I’d recommend just walking around on your own."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Entry fee was 80,000, so not expensive
Tour the Historic Rooms: Explore the president's office, state rooms, and war command room.
View Artifacts and Exhibits: See historical objects and photographs from the Vietnam War era.
Walk Through the Gardens: Enjoy the beautifully landscaped grounds surrounding the palace.

A must-see for anyone curious about Vietnam's modern history."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Wow. You go back in time here with very well preserved rooms and furniture. It's exactly how it was in the days. Many symbolic events took place here. The bunker is brilliant. If you want to go back in history, this is the place to visit."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Very good place to visit for a couple of hours. Will always be remembered for the tanks bursting through the gates and the helicopter taking staff ect from the roof during the final day of war. There is enough information not to need an audio guide. Lovely to see all the furniture there so you get a good feel as to how the rooms were used.
Entrance fee 80k vnd per adult."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Independence Palace in Ho Chi Minh City is a must-visit if you are interested in Vietnam’s modern history. It played a central role during the Vietnam War, serving as the headquarters of the South Vietnamese government. This is also the place where the war officially ended on April 30, 1975, when tanks of the North Vietnamese army broke through its gates, marking the fall of Saigon.

The place gives a unique glimpse into the lifestyle of the ruling family and the political atmosphere of the time. While the architecture looks more like a government complex designed to host international guests rather than a royal palace, the historical importance of this site makes it very memorable and valuable to visit."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"There are many historical exhibitions.
The facility is 3 stories and you can take pictures where ever you want.
I did buy tickets at entrance price of 80.000 including museum admission fee.

Also incide of the palace they do sell beaverage.
Water 15.000
Soft drink 20.000"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"There are different ticket prices at the counter if you buy it on arrival, they called it foreigner price. The Vietnamese guy behind me even speak out and said ""this is how it's work here"".
You can buy a normal price, just one local price on Klook app.
We only want to go see the bunker room. Very tight, narrow, hot and busy space.
The shooting room is pretty cool."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Visited the Independence Palace in Ho Chi Minh City and it was such a fascinating experience! 🇻🇳✨ The place is full of history and gives you a real sense of the country’s past. Everything is very clean and well preserved, and the staff were friendly and helpful throughout the visit.

It’s not just educational but also really impressive to walk through the different rooms and halls. Definitely a must-see when you’re in Ho Chi Minh City! 🌟"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"I recently visited Independence Palace, and I must say, the experience was quite memorable. The palace is absolutely huge much bigger than I had expected. It felt like I was walking through a never ending maze of grand halls, historic rooms, and long corridors. After a while, I actually started to feel tired from all the walking! If you’re planning to explore the entire palace, definitely wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to spend a good few hours there.

One thing I noticed and something that did affect the experience was that many parts of the palace didn’t have air conditioning. Given how hot and humid the weather was during my visit, it got quite uncomfortable in several sections. Some rooms were noticeably stuffy, and at times I found myself rushing through just to get back to cooler areas.

That said, the architecture and historical significance of the palace are undeniable. The design is both elegant and symbolic, and each room seems to hold a story of its own. I especially enjoyed the presidential meeting rooms and the war command center in the basement both were fascinating glimpses into Vietnam’s past.

Overall, while the lack of AC in many areas made the visit a bit exhausting, the sheer scale, historical richness, and grandeur of the Independence Palace still made it worth the trip. I’d recommend it, but maybe plan your visit during cooler parts of the day."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,Well presented and well organized. Easy to self-tour without the audio guide. The film in the basement is very informative too. Available in multiple languages. The bunker was the least impressive place.
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,Impressive historical site with beautiful architecture and well-preserved rooms. A great place to learn about Vietnam’s history and the Vietnam War. Worth a visit!
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"I saw a lot of Vietnamese history and culture. At first, I didn't understand the significance behind the name. Now I see. The Palace shows the strength of the Vietnamese people and their independence from all the colonial powers.
.
The palace looks just like it did in the 70s.
.
I did not know what to expect when I walked into the building. This is a huge piece of history, symbolizing a struggle for freedom and equality.

As a Black man, I recognize the Vietnamese people struggled for freedom at the same time we did during the 70s. Crazy, everyone was just trying to get away from the oppression. I always respected the Vietnamese people and this building shows how hard they fought to be free."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"I personally didn’t enjoy visiting this palace as there wasn’t much to see inside. Most of it consisted of meeting rooms, corridors and dining halls. The place was very hot and humid, as there was no air conditioning not even in the lift.
We paid around 160 VND for two persons, which I felt was not worth it. Parking is  available inside premises.
In my opinion, it’s more suitable for photography/shoots.
I would not recommend it."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"This is also another place for you to add to your places to visit when you come to Ho Chin Minh City.

Beautiful architecture and design, rich in history, this place os a must when you are around!

There’s a small fee to enter the palace, but definitely worth visiting with friends and family."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"It's one of the symbols of the past era, where you can get the look and feel of past times. Without a guide, you can see everything for about 30-40 minutes if you are not reading everything, but it's better to get a guided tour to get a deeper understanding. There are good views, a cafe, and souvenirs inside."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"One of the main tourist attractions that you MUST visit. Personally I love this building. Incorporating eastern and western architecture. It costs just over a quid so you're not going to break the bank! It's touristy obviously but not overcrowded. Just walk around at your own pace and for anyone who can't do the 3 flights of stairs there are lifts - although you will have to walk up to the roof, which is a must to see the helicopter and markings where the palace was bombed. Plus, if you run in the morning it's pretty much exactly 1km around the outside perimeter so easy to keep track of what you've done!!"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"It was nice palace but I didn’t feel anything special there, it was just about the history and few conference rooms. But other people may enjoy."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"A well-preserved landmark in District 1 with deep historical significance — the site where the Vietnam War ended on April 30, 1975. The architecture is mid‑Century modernist with retro period décor. A fascinating museum inside, including original war rooms, bunkers, tanks, and a rooftop helicopter — feels almost frozen in time. Souvenir stalls on the rooftop and in the basement. Sometimes crowded, especially on weekends; it can get warm inside, so bring water and consider an audio guide for context."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"I understand that the Independence Palace holds a very high significance in the history of Vietnam and the independence it experiences up to this day, but as tourist, the palace itself was quite boring. It had a bunch of seminar rooms and halls which I suppose, important events happened in the past, but there were no information posted somewhere explaining what happened in those places. I happened to also visit at the time when it was (I think) Vietnam’s Independence Day celebration, so the place was jampacked with people. I recommend that one visit the palace just for experience, but I don’t see any value to go again more than once unless you’re Vietnamese."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"This is one of my favourite or my favourite building in Saigon. I like the mid-century type of architecture here and it was a very beautiful place in Saigon as is kept up very well compared to many other buildings around the area. You get a walk through many different halls and see the life of the president and where he would Have meetings have guest over for dinner or even he sleeps as well as planning for the attacks in the basement as well, there was a really cool area my opinion as well because I found that it was like frozen in time and most of the things here did not change since the fall of Saigon  got in 1975. 100% a place to check out if you’re into history and if you are not, I still think it is a good area to check out as it’s such a beautiful building and grounds as well it just cool to check out."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,Impressive historical site with beautiful architecture and well-preserved rooms. A great place to learn about Vietnam’s history and the Vietnam War. Worth a visit!
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"An amazing place full of history! Do not miss this place when in Ho Chi Minh City! A building that tells so many stories, with informative signs throughout. It’s incredible to be able to walk through such a historical and significant place!"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"It was the Presidential Palace of the Republic of Vietnam during the North-South governments era.
The basement is a reinforced bunker and also a war info room. The above-ground building is not large but it still has many halls and rooms. When traveling to Ho Chi Minh City, you must come here to experience the historical atmosphere."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"The Independence Palace is a fascinating destination, especially for foreigners interested in Vietnam’s modern history. Visitors can explore the rooms and halls where important political figures once worked and made crucial decisions that shaped the nation. The architecture and preserved interiors offer a glimpse into the political atmosphere of the past. However, for many Vietnamese people, the experience may not feel particularly impressive or emotionally stirring, perhaps due to its familiarity or the way history is presented. Still, it’s worth a visit for those curious about the country’s historical and political background."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,This a very interesting palace. You will find helicopter on the roof. Jeeps. Limousine. Theatre. Kitchen. And various rooms and I assumed it has to do with army stuff. The red colour predominates here. Remember there are 7 floors. There is toilet on each floor. On roof top you will find souvenir shop and a small bar. It is very busy but the palace is huge. The only disturbing thing was the elephant legs. Please keep in mind you need 2 hours together with the garden. I have traveled to the past in this palace.
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"I went here during the mid of May, learned a lot of history in here. It is a big palace with a lot of things to see here. Every piece of the item or the stuff here are labeled and written in English. They even have a free locker to store your item before going into the palace. The scenery is also very beautiful. The only thing is this palace is not air conditioned, but there is a room with historical video about this palace and the history of HCM. The room comes with the language of English, Vietnamese and Chinese, these rooms are air conditioned."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"This was interesting place but going on independence Day probably not the best idea extremely crowded and walking up and down stairs was a nightmare.

It was full of old fashioned gear and showed how they lived which would be good for children to see"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,Just buy the regular admission ticket on the counter and you should already have access to most spots inside. Additional payment if you opt for audio tour but there are english descriptions on the exhibit already if you dont want to opt for one. Good to drop by for a quick tour. Can tour around for approx an hour. Loads of walking & stairs and no AC but the fresh air should be enough.
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"A fascinating and important historical site in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City.
Visiting the Independence Palace was like stepping back in time. The architecture is beautifully preserved, and walking through the different rooms — from the President’s office to the war command center — gives a powerful glimpse into Vietnam’s past.

It was especially moving to see the basement war rooms and the vintage communication equipment. The palace is not only visually impressive but also rich in history and symbolism.

A meaningful experience for anyone interested in Vietnam’s journey through war, independence, and resilience"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"If you’re in Ho Chi Minh City, you definitely shouldn’t miss the Independence Palace! 🇻🇳

It’s a great chance to learn more about Vietnam’s history and get a glimpse into the past. Inside, you can explore the president’s living quarters, the guest lounge, meeting room, game room, and even the underground bunker 😮.

It can get a bit warm in summer, but it’s so worth it for such a unique and valuable experience!"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"The Independence Palace doesn’t just display history—it *lives* it. From the moment you step inside, it feels like time has paused somewhere in the 1960s and 70s. The long wooden conference table still lined with high-backed chairs seems ready for another urgent cabinet meeting. The vintage telephone quietly rests on the president’s desk, as if waiting for one more critical call. The private cinema, the war command room with old radio equipment, even the underground escape tunnels—all whisper stories of a country once divided and the people who made bold decisions in those very rooms. The architecture itself speaks volumes: wide, open hallways reflect the ideals of transparency and progress, while the fusion of Eastern motifs and modernist design captures a Vietnam standing at the crossroads of tradition and change. Walking through the palace feels like walking through chapters of a living history book—each room, each piece of furniture, a storyteller in its own right."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"A must-see in the city, its architecture and interior decoration are impressive
You can spend at least 1-2h in there
You can buy your tickets just on the left of the main entrance"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Make this a part of your touring experience. Incredible history.  I especially enjoyed touring the bunker and communications rooms, trying to imagine the panic and emotion of everyone down there on April 30 1975"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"First time I saw this building was in a video game, surreal actually to be there... Honestly dream like

If a mix of history and architecture could make you emotional, this is a strong candidate 🥲

Cảm ơn rất nhiều 🙏🫂🇩🇰🇻🇳🫂🙏"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"The Reunification Palace (Independence Palace) in District 1, Ho Chi Minh City, stands as a majestic historical landmark, once serving as the residence and workplace of former presidents of South Vietnam.

Its grand architecture, blending modern and classical styles, captivates visitors with sprawling halls, lush gardens, and an aura of timeless elegance. The palace is not only a visual masterpiece but also a treasure trove of Vietnam’s turbulent past, offering a vivid glimpse into the nation’s history.

For just a few tens of thousands of VND, the affordable voice-guided tour is a highlight, narrating the stories behind each room, from opulent reception areas to strategic meeting chambers.

The journey takes you through the palace’s upper floors, adorned with intricate decor, before descending into the secretive basement. This underground bunker, a wartime command center, reveals a fascinating network of tunnels and control rooms, evoking the intensity of Vietnam’s conflict-ridden era. The contrast between the lavish upper levels and the stark, utilitarian bunker underscores the palace’s historical significance.

Visiting the Reunification Palace is a must for anyone seeking to understand Vietnam’s political and cultural heritage. Its well-preserved rooms and immersive storytelling make history come alive. Whether you’re a history enthusiast or a curious traveler, this iconic site offers an unforgettable experience, blending beauty, education, and intrigue.

A trip here is a journey through time, leaving you with a deeper appreciation for Vietnam’s resilient spirit and storied past."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Independence Palace is a must-visit historical destination in Ho Chi Minh City. This iconic building offers profound insights into Vietnam's history, especially the reunification event in 1975. The majestic architecture and interesting photo and artifact collections make this visit worthwhile. A highly educational and historical place."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
A Time Capsule of Vietnam’s History
The Independence Palace is like stepping into a frozen moment in time. The architecture is classic 60s modernist, and walking through the preserved rooms—from the war command center to the president’s quarters—gives you a real feel for Vietnam’s political past.

The underground bunkers were especially fascinating, and the vintage furniture, maps, and communication equipment tell powerful stories. It's not just a building—it's where history stood still.

Ideal for history lovers or anyone wanting a deeper understanding of the Vietnam War era. Give yourself at least an hour to explore at your own pace!"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,Definitely worth checking out if you’re in Saigon. Lots of historical information throughout the museum. Everything is immaculately well kept. I explored this place solo and had a great time checking out the displays and learning about the significance of each room. The underground basement for radio communication was a cool bonus I didn’t know about.
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Great experience if you are interested in American/South Vietnamese History and in Vietnam War and how it started. Visting takes 60 to 90 minutes. The garden of the palace is a quiet oasis in the noisy Saigon. Very peaceful atmosphere, too. One Ticket for an adult costs only 40000 VND and 20000 VND for children under 18."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"It is also known as Independence Palace. If you are interested in history then it is worth seeing. It was office cum residence of President of South Vietnam. One can see a lot of things including an old copter, underground war room and original furniture. The garden is quite big and well kept."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,It was clean and tidy. It attaches you to the history of the city. For more clarification watch documentary. We booked hop on n hop off tickets were included in the price so the entry was hassle free
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,I think it is a must-do as it shows you how the royal family used to live and shows the bunker my favourite part where there are lots of rooms for planning
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Great place to view some of the history of Saigon. All the historical items are well kept as they were back then. Information charts in Vietnamese and  English giving an explanation for each exhibit.

Entrance cost is 40 000 VND (65 000 VND if you include the exhibit, which I did) (exhibit is right next door on the Palace grounds)

You can also rent audio equipment to have listening experience while you walk around.

There are also some cafes on the ground should you want a small snack or drink."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Great to experience. I think you can buy tickets until 3:30pm and walk around until 4:30pm (was nice and quiet at this time) underground bunker is cool, don’t miss the short film they show downstairs"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"The building is beautifully kept, its old bones and details still striking. I found myself wishing for more background onsite, but if you already know a bit of the history, there’s plenty here to appreciate."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,I honestly don’t know why here is so popular for tourists. Yes here is the historical building. But there is nothing in the building. You can see empty rooms that once used by government. I think they can display some old things which represent or explain old days like other museums. There is no air-conditioner in the building. You can feel hot weather and wind that make you exhausted.
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Independence Palace (also known as Reunification Palace) is a must-visit landmark in Ho Chi Minh City, especially if you're interested in Vietnamese history. This was the former presidential residence and the site where the Vietnam War officially ended in 1975, when a North Vietnamese tank crashed through its gates.

The building is very well preserved. You can walk through meeting rooms, the president’s office, living quarters, and even a war command bunker in the basement. Each room is kept as it was decades ago, with original furniture, maps, and communication equipment still in place.

Outside, the palace is surrounded by a large, peaceful garden. The open green space, old tanks on display, and wide courtyard make it a pleasant place to explore.

There are guided tours available or you can walk at your own pace. Information signs in English and Vietnamese help you understand each section.

✅ If you're in Saigon, this is more than just a tourist stop — it’s a window into the country’s past.
Allow 1–2 hours for the full experience."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Visited on a weekday (Thursday), practically no queue for entrance tickets, so it was great. They do recommend and provide guests with audio guides but we only took the map since there's a short queue to get the audio stuff.

The paper map/brochure gives small details about the specific areas, and there'd be signs for reading near the areas so you can be immersed in the history and culture.

Honestly, although a weekday, there were considerably more tourists(?) than I expected, but it was manageable to walk around without feeling crammed etc.

Just saying, the lift is tiny, so it's more of a leg activity when it comes to manoeuvring around. Plus, there's not alot of air conditioning, so prepare your own mini fan or cooling wipes if needed.

Its a really beautiful place, totally worth the money for the exploration of 5 floors + a bunker level."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"If u like history n stuff can come, if not can skip haha, just be a little cautious when buying ticket, make sure u dont pay for what is not necessary lol, the entrance itself is just 40k but when i first went in the ticketing staff asked what language i prefer and straight charge me 190k bruh, if i dont ask she wont tell whats its included, i don’t think that’s fair la, but anyway, just check on what u paying for just in case u mind the fees u paying, else good luck and enjoy"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Walking through the Independence Palace feels like stepping into a time capsule. The building has been preserved to look exactly as it did in the 1970s, with original furniture, décor, and equipment still in place.

I really enjoyed exploring the different rooms — from formal meeting halls to the president’s living quarters and the secret command bunker in the basement. Each space tells a different part of Vietnam’s complex history.

The highlight for me was the basement, with its old radios, maps, and military setup. You can really imagine what it was like during wartime decision-making.

The palace grounds are peaceful and green, with fountains, shaded walkways, and even tanks displayed on the lawn. It’s hard to believe such a quiet spot was once the center of intense conflict.

Tips:

Visit early to avoid crowds and heat

Allow time to walk the entire palace — it’s bigger than it looks

Don’t skip the bunker!"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,Very famous place in Ho Chi Minh City. Nicely maintain the History and Culture of Vietnam.
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"This is one of the most visited buildings in Ho Chi Minh City. The place used to be the headquarters of the president of South Vietnam, from where he monitored the events of the war. As you enter, there is a very big courtyard before entering the main building. The building itself has three floors, each dedicated to something special during the time it was used as a president's palace. The most interesting part for me was the basement, where the president spent most of the time during the war.

Cosider that the placegets very crowded. I went on a weekend and there was a huge number of school kids for a visit. It makes congestion in the stairs, and the air is stuffy as there is very little ventilation. I am unsure as there are times when it is less crowded, but this is a point to consider if you intend to visit."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,A place marked by profound historical narratives and political debate. Only by exploring various sources and witnessing it firsthand can one truly understand that this is not merely a tourist attraction.
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"A bunch of large rooms, and that's it! A couple of tanks, a fighter jet, helicopter. Not really worth 80k dong, 30-40k Is more appropriate for what little there was to see."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"A great start to learn about the history of the country!
You learn about the different wars and uprisings. It gives you a peak into the struggles of the people in the recent past."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"As a traveler deeply moved by culture and history, visiting Independence Palace in Ho Chi Minh City was one of the most powerful experiences during my trip through Vietnam. This iconic landmark, once the residence of South Vietnam’s president, became the symbol of national reunification when tanks rolled through its gates on April 30, 1975—a moment that marked the end of the Vietnam War and the beginning of a unified nation.
Walking through its halls, you feel the weight of history. The preserved war rooms, vintage communications gear, and elegant 1960s architecture offer a rare glimpse into a pivotal time. The lush gardens and open spaces add a sense of peace and reflection—so different from the turmoil the building once witnessed. April 30th, now celebrated as Reunification Day, brings the palace to life with local pride. Flags wave, families gather, and the stories of resilience and peace echo louder. It's a deeply moving day to be there and feel the spirit of Vietnam—strong, unified, and full of hope. If you're traveling through Vietnam, don’t miss this site. It’s more than just a building—it’s a living chapter of the nation’s soul!"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,This is a must visit in Ho Chi Minh City. Strong Bond vibes with the mid 20th century architecture. The building is fantastic and you can sense the history here.
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Visited on July 7. The Independence Palace is an impressive historic site in the center of Ho Chi Minh City. It served as the official residence and workplace of the South Vietnamese President until 1976, and today it’s open as a museum and convention hall. Tickets cost 40,000 VND for the palace, 65,000 VND for palace + exhibition, and 100,000 VND for the e-rickshaw ride. You can also buy a separate 25,000 VND ticket for the exhibition.

The palace is huge, and there’s a lot of walking involved. It includes the preserved meeting rooms, offices, underground bunker, and the rooftop with a helicopter. There is no AC in the corridors, so visiting during cooler weather is ideal. One lift was working during our visit, so it was tiring but worth it. A great place to understand Vietnam’s modern history."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Probably the second best attraction in the city, after the War Remnants Museum. The separate exhibition (which focuses on mid 1800s to mid 1900s Saigon) is worth visiting. No need to pay the 90k for the audio tour - there is plenty of signage and photos sharing the rich history of the palace. Allocate about 2 hours to really soak it all in. You can’t buy tickets online, so may have to wait a while, but once you’re inside it’s not crowded at all"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"I arrived quite late, so I had to rush to explore as much as I could. It’s a beautiful building and a great place to have a glimpse into the Ngo Dinh Diem regime. On top of that, the securities are super nice. They patiently wait for us to see around (we tried to see around quickly tho) and then close each rooms after our visits"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"The Mog Champ sends his regards.

A landmark of great historical importance, even if you don't know much of the history like myself, it's a great place to walk around and walk inside to see what those government buildings used to be like.

You could also access their balconies and bunkers which gives you an idea of their structure. In the end, it's a family friendly place to be unlike the war museum close by.

Mogliest Regards,
Your Mog Champ"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"A highly significant site for the keen modern historian; I think one of the tanks there is the one that first stormed the gate during the fall of Saigon. Both the interior and exterior architecture is a highlight, though there could be some more information presented on the inside of the building. Make sure to see the helicopter on the roof and the bunker, which are both potentially skipped over for thou who lack a keen eye."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"After entry there are free lockers to keep bigger bags in - I had a cabin bag I’d purchased from the market so the locker was welcomed.
Well worth the visit to understand the function and history of the different areas of the palace as each room includes information in english. Some groups both large and small had local guides but we found everything self explanatory. However, we did listen in on a guide’s explanations of different areas from time to time. Like most venues there is a souvenir shop. All floors had a WC. Water could be purchased on the top level."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Beautiful 70s interior designs and architecture for just ~$2. However, there is no AC besides gift shop and documentary room, so make sure to go early in the morning.

Constructive criticism here, the guard pointed out where to go after I got my ticket, but other than that, no one was interested in handing out the pamphlet/map, no signs directing on where to go so it was like maze, and stairs were blocked off. Plus, nothing was on in the documentary room."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,Vnd80k entrance fee for adults is reasonable but only for those interested in history and war.
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,Not a worrh watching . As a monument and to know the crew history of Americans did to Vietnam.. visit the museum and see the photos
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Interesting,insightful and well curated - with lots of information about the history not only of the palace but of Saigon during the South Vietnam period"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,Excellent museum...the best in HCMC in my opinion.  The history is explained well and the rooms feel that they have not changed since 1960. There is no airconditioning but the way it is built yiu do get some relief from the heat.
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,Loved every minute of this…definitely recommended and awesome value for money. Lots of spots for coffee and drinks inside so don’t worry about that. I recommend taking the audio tour.
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,This is a very expansive building with very spacious rooms which are similarly furnished - a lot of chairs and tables. The grounds are vast and beautiful to wander around. We paid for tickets to enter an additional building on the grounds but were never asked to show the tickets when we walked in. It almost felt that the tickets were not required for entry. There is a welcomed patio cafe on the grounds which is great to sit there under the big umbrellas.
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,Very interesting Palace. You see everything from the Presidents Quarters to the Army Bunker Station. Beautiful Grounds as well
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Well worth the visit. Very interesting museum. Expect to take about half a day here if you want to take your time and explore the grounds, too."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Independence Palace – District 1, HCMC
A stunning modernist masterpiece with deep historical roots. This iconic landmark—where the Fall of Saigon unfolded—is beautifully preserved as a museum and convention venue. Visitors can explore presidential rooms, underground command bunkers, and significant artifacts like the tank gate, rooftop helicopter, and command Jeep. Tickets are affordable (65 k VND adults, 45 k for students, free for kids under six), and it’s open from 8 AM to 4:30 PM daily. Best time to visit: early morning for a peaceful, photo-ready experience."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"This was an interesting part of history to explore and learn about.
We spent a few hours going through the different floors and down into the bunkers.
Each room still set up as it would have been.
The guided headsets are a must as they provide so much more insight into the palace."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,It shows a great insight of how the South Vietnamese Government ran their country during the American/Vietnam War. You can really see everything from the bedroom of the leader to the communications room at the basement. It was even better going during the time when they were setting up the 50th anniversary celebration event on the premises.
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Located at Ben Thanh, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam 🇻🇳
You should not visit Ho Chi Minh without going to the Independent Palace (also known as the Reunification Palace). It holds so much history. I was thoroughly impressed with the tour. The palace is basically a museum dedicated to the victory of North Vietnam over the South. The Palace and surrounding gardens are beautiful and immaculately kept. It was really interesting to visit the bunkers and situation rooms at the bottom of the Palace. Also the huge halls used by the President and government of South Vietnam. It’s very interesting to visit and listen to the guide explaining all the artifacts and what happened in each room. You also get to see the President’s personal car. The Palace itself is a very impressive example of 1960’s architecture with very bold colours. It holds very historical significance as it is the site where the Vietnam War effectively ended with the North Vietnamese tanks crashing through the Palace gates in 1975. This was a very interesting and educational experience for me and I am so glad I got to visit. Would definitely recommend. Thumbs Up!!! 👍👍👍"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Would be way better if the palace is air conditioned. Less crowded than other attractions in the city.

If you visiting highly recommending get the audio translator or a guide to get a better experience, otherwise you’ll be a bit lost cause the palace is a huge building with a hidden rooms that you could missed without a guide.

Well preserved and maintained palace. LOVE IT! Within walking distance from ben thanh market."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Entrance to the entire complex is 65,000 VND, which is quite reasonable. The site is overall very pleasant – clean, well-maintained, and with a calm atmosphere. It’s not overwhelmingly large, but definitely worth a visit if you’re spending time in Ho Chi Minh City.

Given that Saigon doesn’t have a huge number of historical landmarks compared to other cities in Vietnam, this place really stood out and made for a nice cultural experience. I appreciated the chance to explore something that gives a glimpse into the country’s past.

If you’re interested in history or just looking for a peaceful break from the busy streets, I’d recommend stopping by."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"I’m really surprised with the rich history of this place. Besides history, I would like to mention the architecture is really nice and looks like modern fancy house nowadays. Add to that I was came here with groups, so it takes time to queue and waiting for the ticket but, the experience + historical explanation from the tour guide is no doubt, great."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"This iconic landmark in the heart of Ho Chi Minh City offers a glimpse into Vietnam’s modern history and the significant events that shaped the nation.

The architecture itself is striking, with a 1960s modernist design surrounded by expansive gardens. As we walked through the palace, we marveled at the beautifully preserved rooms, each a snapshot of the era. The retro furniture, communication equipment, and the impressive banquet halls made it feel like we were traveling back in time.

The basement war rooms were especially intriguing, filled with old maps and telecommunication devices that evoked the gravity of the decisions made there. While we didn’t have a guide to walk us through the palace, the signage and displays provided enough context to understand its historical significance. However, we couldn’t help but feel that a guided tour might have brought the stories and events to life more vividly.

Standing on the balcony where history was made was a surreal experience. It’s incredible to think of the historic moments this building has witnessed, particularly during the fall of Saigon."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,It's a great place to visit if you're interested in Vietnam history. I would recommend this place to every traveller.
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Independence palace is good. Can visit once. But if you have to make a choice between one of these places-  Independence palace and War museum, I would recommend War museum."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Good to visit and see the inside of the new building, could do with a tour guide to give more context for the rooms and the history of the building.
The exhibition was not in order and had a few different rooms of different content."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Highly recommend for History Buffs and people who want to have good photos taken 😂.
The Day we reached was just before TET (New year) so it was full of young couple taking pictures.
The palace was good, I didn't feel the need to take an audio guide, as most of the things are written on the boards near each place (maybe it would have been better to take an actual guide). Its quite big, so it might take at least a couple of hours to complete.
There are different parts which required extra tickets to visit."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"If you love history and/or are fascinated by older architecture/woodwork then I say entering the Independence Palace is a must. You get to see the type of household furniture/set up and how previous residents lived/entertained guests in this building. Other than that, it’s literally an exhibit displaying the different rooms housed in this palace. You cannot step foot in any of the rooms which is understandable, but to be frank, this is a “one and done” visit for me. It is well-maintained with multiple audio languages to follow on a headset you can rent at the front desk which explains the history of the rooms etc. but besides that, it’s not all that."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Wow what as cool place! This was incredible to see and I was truly shocked how big it was! It kept getting bigger and bigger everytime I went into a new room. The bedrooms, meeting rooms, game room and balcony were really cool to see! The bunker in the basement was fascinating and really interesting to see how they were prepared for war and other life threatening situations. Truly a great piece of history I definitely recommend checking this place out!"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,Informative historical place. Definitely pair this up with the war museum as well for proper context.
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Very cool historic place. There are a few cafes outside. Ticket price is 65.000 for adults, children are free to enter."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,Had a nice day to look at the palace access all levels with no pressure to move trough quickly price is around $2.40 AUD
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,Very interesting place to visit. I really had no idea about the REAL history of Vietnam and its regions. So many displays and memorabilia
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,It's so huge and well built. Each part of the building has its own explanation and below ground bunkers are worth the experience
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Fascinating insight and history of the former Presidential Palace, in the former Saigon. Restored to its 1960’s era condition, with a number of military vehicles and aircraft fitted around the grounds of the Palace.

Well worth a visit whilst in Ho Chi Minh City"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Interesting place if you're interested in the Aesthetics of the 70s as this place is a time capsule of that era, overall the war Remnants Museum is better if you looking for info on the Vietnam War, though you do get insight into the puppet leaders put in place by the western imperialist."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"It's ok, not breathtaking at all. Of course, it's a historically significant building."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"History happened here. At first we were skeptical to visit this. However, almost the entire building is open for visitors. You can go almost in every room. There are descriptions of historical events which happened in every room. After the visit we ended up reading about the history of Vietnam. Must visit if you are in Ho Chi Minh."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Important building to see in Saigon, to learn about the country's history. But too many hawkers around the gate spoil the experience."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Beautiful, eclectic modernist building with so many layers of history, art styles and personality."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,Many people come around and all the things is so good condition. I even goimg to the bunker and feel the pressure there. You can taking so many aesthetic pictures.
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"A must visit in Saigon. To avoid crowds, visit on a a weekday. Full of history."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,A very impressive building.. Definatly want to get the audio guide or a guided tour to get the full experience.. you can go to the roof and see the helicopter and also to the underground bunker. Well presented and a great sense of the past ..
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Independence Palace (Reunification Palace) is a must-see for anyone interested in Vietnam War history. With its impressive architecture, war relics, and deep historical significance, it offers a powerful glimpse into Vietnam’s unification. Unfortunately, we arrived late and couldn’t go inside, but the gates and exterior were still remarkable. We managed to take some photos and could still feel the historical importance from outside. Definitely one of the must-visit places in Ho Chi Minh City."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Buys tickets at the ticket gate house, 65000 and per adult, but that includes the palace and the history of vietnam exhibit."
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,Was here just days before the 50th anniversary of the reunification. Was a unique experience due to everyone dressed in their finest. Well worth a visit.You can actually see the original tank they used to breach the gate with.
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"I would definitely recommend you visit this palace if you are into learning about how important people of the past used to live. As a history nerd and a person who appreciates beautiful places, I really enjoyed the Independence Palace!"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"An historical place with loads of stories.. everything preserved to the best.. could get a feel of how the war room operated during the conflict, the architecture is amazing, a must visit place in Saigon/ Ho Chi Minh City
The footage played in the documentary room was super informative and nice..
Time well spent"
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,Not outstanding but it is okay to visit to pass time by if raining outside. Level 1 was not visible as it was holding some kind of event. A bit overpriced?
ChIJL0dwVTgvdTERao3t8B1Jhxc,"Worth seeing it.. We can imagine how Parliament worked, it's still intact. Good atmosphere, nice gardens, full green art."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"We stayed in the Hanoi Old Quarter and it was nothing short of amazing!  We experienced the people, culture and atmosphere of the Old Quarter.  Walking through the busy streets was both exhilarating and quite the adventure navigating people, cars and motorcycles.  It was a rush!  The people are friendly, kind and welcoming and some became like family.  I HIGHLY recommend staying at a hotel in the Old Quarter and experiencing it for yourself."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Hanoi Old Quarter is a lively and fascinating part of the city filled with history, culture, and endless energy. The narrow streets are packed with shops, cafes, and street food vendors, making it a great place to explore on foot. It can get crowded and noisy, but that’s part of its charm. The mix of old architecture and modern life gives it a unique atmosphere that really captures the spirit of Hanoi."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Hanoi Old Quarter is a lively area full of history, culture, and bustling local life. The narrow streets are lined with shops selling clothes, souvenirs, handicrafts, and much more. Bargaining is common here—if you negotiate politely, prices can drop significantly, so good bargaining skills really help!

It’s best to visit in the morning or evening for a more comfortable walk. The atmosphere is energetic and offers a true glimpse into Hanoi’s local charm."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"A melting pot of eateries, arts gallery, cafe, bun Cha street hawkers, nick knack stores and manymore. Walking on the side walk is a real challenge as every corner a d space are taken up by motorcycle parking. Regardless there much excitement and fun in navigating through these chaos. Very colourful."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"It is located in the center of hanoi. You can shop, eat local food, find a good place to stay, have a massage, and stroll around the landmarks. This place is perfect since it is very accessible to everything. It is crowded though, but it looks safe; I've been here 3x and still didn't feel unsafe."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"I love the Old Quarter in Hanoi! Coming up from Da Nang was a nice change. I've embraced the hustle and bustle of the city and I will miss the people when I leave. You can definitely see the French colonial architecture throughout the old quarter. Hanoi is full of charm and so much history. Tons of quaint little shops, cafes, pubs and restaurants, along with museums and monuments. I definitely recommend spending some time here in the Old Quarter in Hanoi City."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,Beautifully manic with wonderful night markets and plenty of shopping ! We went in late September and it was hot at about 32 degrees and very humid . Lots to see from pagoda to lakes and Hanoi (Hilton ) prison to water puppet shows ....
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"The cultural heart of Hanoi. I think it's the best place to stay when visiting, with so many places to eat, see ans jump out of the way of! Lol."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Visited a few years ago with my family. It was an eye opener because on Fri Sat and Sun evenings, all the roads were closed for people to enjoy.

And it is organised by section, with each section catering to the interests of different age groups.

Toddlers can drive toy cars and play uno stackers on the closed roads.

Kids a little older can do arts and crafts and play games.

Teenagers and young adults can dance and sing with their instruments or busker, play ball games, play chartek, tug of war or just sit around to chill with their pets.

Older adults and elderly have their own sections to do rock and roll and ballroom dancing.

And much more.

I felt the community spirit as the local people reached out to welcome me to join in and i did.

We should have this in all cities to promote social harmony.

There are many shops, cafes, eateries and very beautiful hotels (local and international) in the old quarters. I recommend staying there over the weekends and in local hotels. The service and food are impeccable."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Hanoi’s Old Quarter is a lively, historic district full of charm.

ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"This is the place where almost all of Hanoi's landmarks are situated within a waking distance. Old and quaint houses and buildings dot this area intersected by narrow lanes. The old quarter hosts money exchanges, beer street, night market, and other landmarks. You'd be well advised to find a hotel in this area if you wish to be in the heart of action."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"This place is the single most overstimulating place on earth and we loved it. Nowhere is safe from the chaos but there’s so many places to eat, drink, see and things to do that your options are to go with it or get out"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Visited the Hanoi Old Quarter for the night market, and it was a vibrant and lively experience! The quality of the products was surprisingly good—definitely not the typical touristy stuff.

However, a quick reality check: the prices aren’t exactly “cheap” when compared to India, so that’s a bit of a myth. That said, the overall experience was great—the atmosphere, the variety, and the energy of the place make it worth a visit!"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Hanoi Old Quarter is very crowded, but all prices are cheaper than in nearby areas. You will see a lot of street food, massage shops, and bars at good prices"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Excellent area to stay in. Easy access to food, tourist areas, and walkable to french quarter. Lots of hotels and spas, near to night market and many good food spots. Hustle and hustle and would recommend to stay here too get a good feeling of City center."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"This area turns into a party in the evening when tourists come out to dine and drink. 10000% touristy so prices reflect that.

Many hustlers try to get tourists to patronize their ‘bar/club’ by pulling out their phones and showing you videos of their so-called free party. If you are willing to risk your kidney, by all means, follow them.

非常喧嘩的一條街廓"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Hanoi Old Quarter is an unforgettable experience and the vibrant heart of Vietnam’s capital. Walking through its maze-like streets feels like traveling through time — a place where history, culture, and everyday life blend seamlessly. The narrow alleys are packed with energy, motorbikes weaving through the crowd, colonial-era architecture, ancient temples, and a sense of organized chaos that’s uniquely Hanoi.

Each street tells its own story, often named after the trade or craft once practiced there — from Silk Street to Silver Street. The local food scene is unbeatable! You can grab a bowl of authentic pho, bite into a flavorful banh mi, or sip on Hanoi’s famous egg coffee in one of the many hidden cafés.

Shopping is a true adventure — filled with markets, souvenir stalls, and tiny shops selling everything from handcrafted items to trendy clothes. Bargaining is expected, so bring your best negotiating skills.

At night, the atmosphere becomes even more electric. Ta Hien Street is perfect for a cold beer, and the nearby Hoan Kiem Lake offers a peaceful escape amidst the buzz. Don’t miss the water puppet shows for a taste of traditional Vietnamese entertainment. A must-visit destination that captures the soul of Vietnam!"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"A must visit and a popular place in Hanoi. The old quarter is a very busy place with lots of shops and tourist roaming and this area contains all kinds of shops selling different kinds of goods - Clothes, bags, souvenirs, food, fruits and veggies etc.

However, it’s an extremely busy city, making it difficult to get around without getting hit by a motorbike…even when walking on the sidewalks. If you’re looking for relaxation and moderate sanitation, Hanoi isn’t for you."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"We came here during weekend and the entire place was car free with lots of night activities, night market stalls, bustling cafes, bars & restaurants to suit every kind of budget. The only downside was the weather which was extremely hot & humid in the month of August. It was very hard to call for ride hailing as the traffic was jammed packed with honking scooters left right & centre. We were dying for air condition after walking for almost one hour."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"A vibrant old quarter with many quaint old shops.  We ordered an EV vehicle to take us around the old quarters, so we can see all the streets.  The EV vehicle is charged per vehicle, not by number of pax.  The driver was so friendly and he even introduced the signature restaurants and shops."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,Good place to experience traditional culture of Hanoi. Ancient town is more interesting at night with F&B and other activities. Great place to visit.
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Hanoi old quarter is really beautiful with lots of food joints, shopping center, beautiful night view. Must more things to do in Hanoi old quarter. Quite happening place in entire Hanoi. Restaurants are really good with reasonable price."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Very busy, a lot of restaurants and bars to choose from. Definitely an experience to have when you come to hanoi."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Sooooo many shops, bars, coffee shops, food! It’s crazy and a must go area"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,Great place for tourists to hangout eat and drink and also for shopping. Very colorful and happening
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,grat Place to find all kinds of Food Services and Hotels and Bars mostly busy till 10 pm on weekends till late. best transport with motorcycle or walk and explore to your Heart extend
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,Best shop in Hanoi. If you want to buy arcteryx and moncler with good quality this is the place to go to! Owner of the shop is a very nice man.
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"If you love the hustle and bustle of a big city you'll love Hanoi's Old Quarter. It's noisy, vibrant and a foodie paradise! Do try and stay in this area too. It's an experience of a life time!"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"It is a magical place. I lost a few times, because the streets in the morning and evening look different. Decently a must visit place and just enjoy and walk. If you can follow the landmark route wick walks at the edge of old quarter. Lot of shops, lot of coffeee and beer. You can have everything here."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Entertaining street. Best to buy souvenirs from art shops. They are cute, different but priced little on the higher side due to their uniqueness."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Old Vietnam streets. Crowded and best to walk around the town and you can see more, instead of taking public transport"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Good for city walk. Numerous buildings decorated with local styles. If you want to take photos about Hanoi or Vietnam, this community would be your first choice. Also have tons of souvenir shops, coffee shops, restaurants, Spa & nails, travel agencies, diamonds and gem shops(for money change, diamond shops will offer you a better exchange rate than bank and travel agency)."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"The Old Quarter is an intriguing neighborhood, home to a mix of Vietnamese architecture, ancient shops, and fresh-as-it-gets street food, and can be easily explored on foot.

It's very chaotic and its constant motion is part of the charm. You'll see bicycle vendors selling fruits, and fresh flowers. Explore hidden alleyways, secluded pagodas and temples, and cosy coffee shops."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,So many things to do and explore here Hanoi Old Quarter
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,Perfect for back packers and travel enthusiasts. Amazing street food and exclusive restaurants
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"City life hits different. It's just that it's so dirty, trash is everywhere. Overall it's nice to visit hanoi old quarter, it's where the cheepest accomodation are. lol. Nearby aha cafe, at night you can try the banana crepe, it's tasty! You MUST try their Pho (any food stalls that offers pho), you won't be dissappointed. My favorite coffee is the Bac Xiu, you should try it. Hihi. Note: Don't visit on chinese new year because all the prices were exepensive, literally everything."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"The Hanoi old quarter is an amazing vibrant place to hang out.
It’s a real treat for all your senses!
We just love wondering around the streets and exploring 💕"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Good location to buy stuff, night market only open in weekends"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,Hà Nội walking tour. 12km. Old Quarter. Long Bien. Red River bank. Hot chocolate. Hoan Kiem Lake. Winter Markets. Citadel. With a wine and charcuterie detour at Colette's mid-stream. Fresh north winds bring clear conditions - a beautiful traverse.
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"This is the heart of downtown Hanoi and it is always crowded. There are numerous places to eat and shop all throughout the area. You need to be very careful of the motorbike riders as they are a lot of them here, really a lot."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"A good and reasonable place to stay in hanoi

I enjoyed the local food, local beer shop that is phong bia

The people are really helpful and welcoming here

Everyone helps you and welcomes you, so many options for vegetarians and vegans are present in reasonable prices

ATMs are near and this street has weekend markets that sell cool stuff in affordable prices"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Hanoi’s Old Quarter is a vibrant and fascinating place. Imagine nearly 40 narrow streets, each named after the primary goods or services sold there. It’s like stepping into a time capsule – antique brick houses lining the lanes, resisting the fast-paced changes of modern Hanoi. You’ll find cozy coffee cafes, bustling street food stalls, and the famous Beer Street. While the culture and history of Vietnam are beautifully preserved here, it can get quite noisy and chaotic. So, if you’re visiting for the first time, embrace the energy but bring some earplugs! 🇻🇳🏮🍜🛵"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Hanoi, and its huge night market is a great place to shop, but the streets have everything you could possibly need or imagine. Always haggle, it’s part of the culture, especially in the Old Quarter area. It’s undoubtedly the most traditional of the markets, always very busy, and you can find everything here in small shops and street stalls. Steers always packed with people, street art, food."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"This is probably one of my favorite locations around Hanoi as you get a real feel for the hustle and bustle of the city from within the Old Quarter.  You get to see every age of Vietnamese at work and play and feel the real vibe of a busy city.  The old quarter takes you back in time to how life was, and still is, for many with shoppers and traders and eaters all competing for tiny spaces on streets.  Within this you also get to visit Train Street to see one of the most iconic and memorable views of the middle of Hanoi - by far this was my favorite afternoon to sit and watch the train go by within mm of your nose!!  A beautiful city full of hard working, wonderful people who live life on a dime but do it with a big smile, welcome and engaging personality that makes you feel both welcome and respected!! I love Hanoi!"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"When you visit Hanoi, I highly recommend spending time in the Old Quarter. This historic heart of the city is a fascinating blend of the past and the present, featuring narrow streets each traditionally dedicated to a specific trade, such as silk, spices, or handicrafts.

And make sure also venture out of the district to other parts of Hanoi.

Begin your exploration at Hoan Kiem Lake, ideally in the early morning for a tranquil experience. The lake is a central piece of the Old Quarter and is home to the charming Ngoc Son Temple, situated on a small island.

Don’t miss the opportunity to visit Dong Xuan Market, Hanoi's largest indoor market, where you can immerse yourself in the vibrant local culture and shop for everything from souvenirs to fresh produce.

Make sure to visit St. Joseph’s Cathedral to witness a stunning example of Hanoi’s French colonial architecture and enjoy a moment of peace in its serene interior.

The culinary scene in the Old Quarter is not to be overlooked. Indulge in authentic Vietnamese street food, including dishes like Pho, Bun Cha, and the unique Egg Coffee.

If your visit falls over a weekend, the Night Market on Hang Dao Street is a must-see. It’s perfect for experiencing the lively atmosphere and picking up unique local items.

The Old Quarter is not just a place to visit, but an experience to be lived. It offers a profound glimpse into the dynamic fusion of historical charm and bustling city life in Hanoi"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"The Hanoi old Quarter may be iconic, but your lungs won't thank you. There were so many people without masks. Please realise that you are not doing yourselves any favours by breathing in the fumes.
The shopping in Hanoi is better than Saigon. The food was not bad.  If you have the time, visit Aeon Mall."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Hanoi Old Quarter is the heart of the city's nightlife. During the day, it's a bustling marketplace with shops selling souvenirs, clothing, and food. On weekends, the streets are closed to traffic and even more vendors come out to sell their wares.

Nice place for stay and walking around."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Nice place for shopping, chilling out, partying, even enjoying alone time. Great eating and coffee options. Shopping hub. Also has a beautiful lake and church in close vicinity"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"I would say that if you visit Hanoi without come to this place, it's really a pity. There are many cultural & spiritual sites inside the Old Quarter and surrounding areas. Take time to walk around and enjoy authentic Hanoi here."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Good market , you can buy anything you want here, just be sure to negotiate a good 50% discount for yourself"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"I have lived on and off in Hanoi for the last 10 months. The Old Quarter is my favourite area by far. Great art, food and craft beer, great shops and tourist sites, beautiful parks and lakes... If you're coming to Hanoi, you want to stay in the Old Quarter."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"I took a private tour, a half day tour around the old Quarter, the guide takes you to all the important places e.g Pagoda in the middle of the lake, the Prison and the French quarters, toh can also taste some good local Vietnamese lunch which the guide can help you choose. I would always prefer you to take the guide they are really helpful."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Definitely a must visit for any tourist. It was loud, busy, loads of vendors. Boat ride on the river isn't anything special but something you have to do as a tourist."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Hanoi Old Quarter is the heart of the city which Is a very happening area and where you can find several eateries, many famous cafes etc.
I enjoyed the vibes of the Hanoi City, especially in this area. Had a wonderful food and shopping experience here and the best part is that the people are very kind, friendly and welcoming even though there was a language barrier."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"An area in Hanoi, Vietnam is called the Old Quarter.  The area is very beautiful.  Every day tourists from different parts of the world come here to visit.  I visited here myself.  The security situation is very good.  The city is well organized.  The market condition here is also good.  Shopping can be done for very little money.  Food shops of different countries are here.  People's behavior is also sincere.  I can recommend everyone to visit here."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,Nice ambience and atmosphere when you visited this place at night.
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"One of the most interesting places we ever visited. Vibrant, addictively chaotic. As AB said, happiness is a bowl of pho on a plastic seat. Make sure to experience. Great food, great shopping and above all else the people of Vietnam are welcoming and friendly."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"We rented a hotel in the old quarter. Not realizing when we booked that it would be a week before the national celebration. Train street was the only thing worth seeing and the prison. Otherwise I found the city completely congested, over run by scooters and difficult to walk around."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Hanoi Old Quarter is an amazing place full of life, history, and culture. The streets are busy and colorful with shops, cafés, street food, and markets everywhere you look. You can really feel the charm of the city with its mix of old architecture and modern energy. It’s a great area to walk around, try local food, and experience the real atmosphere of Hanoi. A must-visit when in Vietnam!"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Love the hope of old quarter.  The beeping the fast pace of scooters.  The laughs. The food.
It’s a great experience"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Its difficult to rate this place if, like me, you come to Vietnam for the scenery and culture. I wanted to see the capital, experience it for myself, and whilst it really is an experience not to be missed,  a couple of days here was plenty for me. There are things to do, places not to miss, but it is completely crazy, noisy and chaotic.  I'm not discrediting it by any means, it's just not the part of Vietnam that I enjoy."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"We loved the old quarter, the place is teaming with life.

Some may find the air pollution an issue if they suffer from asthma."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,Everything you look for when shopping prices medium prices but also good stuff
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"We had a walkabout around the blocks n i was quite attracted to a number of things ie: where they have dinner by the street on small stools n tables, the night market, the traffic where everyone zig-zag their way thru, though di not get the opportunity to really sit down n enjoy the view @ life. Nevertheless it was quite an experience"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,This is the best shop in hanoi of you wanna buy good clothes. Everything is good quality and the owner is very nice and funny.
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Charming - very touristy and commercial, but bursting with character. Lots of nooks with various layers of this city’s history evident. Take some time to explore it in your own."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Old Quarter is hectic place filled with shops. Old Quarter contains around 36 streets in total. You can find handcrafts, jewellery, clothing, road side eateries, temples, cafes, Ancient houses, Night market. It’s all in one place for exploring Hanoi night life. If you are a beer lover, do visit Beer Street( Old Quarter Ta Hien Corner). But keep in mind that the place is fully crowded. You can find only local shops and local food.."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,I love Hanoi old Quarter will back here for sure.
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Be prepared for a lot of scooters, crowds and shops. Taken that into account, I actually enjoyed walking through the streets of the old quarter, having a drink or food from a vendor and generally soak in the bustling and colourful atmosphere."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Stayed at Hanoi Pearl Hotel with Rooftop Bar and Lakeview & City Lookout. Central Location within the Old Quarters, Hanoi"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Magical,action,bars,clubs and of course

Masaj,masaj,masaj  ))))"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,What a place to visit so much to see and do train street the lake and temple do some kind of tour of the city to get the most out of it 3 days is more than enough when crossing the road just walk across the bikes and cars will miss you takes some getting used to but it works
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"This is what I expected Hanoi to look like.   ... And so does everyone else..  lots of travelers coming here, so don't expect locals living a quiet existence.  It's a very active area with bars restaurants and shops, especially at night."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"It’s compact and easy to look around on foot and so many good local food around. This is a touristy place, but you still get to see so many local activities."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"The Old Quarter (Vietnamese: Phố cổ Hà Nội) is the name commonly given to the historical civic urban core of Hanoi, Vietnam, located outside the Imperial Citadel of Thăng Long. This quarter used to be the residential, manufacturing and commercial center, where each street was specialized in one specific type of manufacturing or commerce.
The residential and commercial area that is now the Old Quarter came to be during the Lý and Trần dynasties and was then located east of the Imperial Citadel of Thăng Long and along the Red River. During the Lê dynasty, scholar Nguyễn Trãi already mentioned some of the areas each specialized in one particular trade. It was then surrounded by a defensive wall with several gates.
During the Lê dynasty, the area included several lakes and wetlands, the largest of which was Thái Cực lake. These lakes, as well as the Tô Lịch River were connected with Hoàn Kiếm lake and the Red River. Near the end of the 19th century these lakes and rivers became isolated from each other.
During the Lý and Trần dynasties, many people from the surrounding plains migrated to the city and settled in what is now the Old Quarter, creating the densest urban area of the city. The Lê dynasty period saw an additional influx of Chinese immigrants who arrived to trade, creating several Chinese neighbourhoods..
When the French ruled over Vietnam, they partially rebuilt the area. This period saw many French and Indians settling there to conduct business. Two small markets were demolished to make place for Đồng Xuân Market. Furthermore, a tramway was constructed through the quarter.
The area is still the commercial heart of Hanoi.
Overall I like Hanoi a lot especially the architectural buildings and I don't bore walking around as so much to see here except those horns from the motorcycle, that's insane"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"The old quarter has a lot of charm and we were able to see a lot of the vibrant Vietnamese culture within the quarter. However, crossing the street does become stressful as there are many motorbikes so just be careful. we especially enjoyed the shopping, food and coffee!"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Very very busy place , all people around for photos , Cantre of Hanoi many shops and Resturent around easy to reach , no place to park , need extra care for kids in this place"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Not a fan of chaos at all. This place is pure chaos. If you like crazy drivers, lots of bikes, dirty streets, dirtier street food and constant honking go here. I really don't know what people find attractive about this place."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,Best Starbucks in the universe! I must have been here a dozen times. I’ll definitely visit again when I’m back in the city. Coffee is not your usual Starbucks beans. Far superior than any place else. There’s a separate bar for high end coffees too. Incredible food! Fresh pastries and sandwiches. The employees are incredibly focused on making my visit a wonderful experience.
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"I love the bustling energy of this part of Hanoi! Simply walking the streets and taking it all in was a treat every time. The chaotic yet fascinating traffic flow, combined with the endless shops and street vendors, adds so much vibrancy to the fabric of this historic city—definitely a must-visit!"
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,Best place to shop and experience local food. Must to go place in vietnam.
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,Suggest you spend 2 full days here to walk around and explore. The costs is very low and you could eat at the streets. Myself did not get sick. You are suggested to order a coffee and sit on the street to feel the relax moment.
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,"Vibrant part of Hanoi where you can shop, eat, drink or get a massage. Good night life with a lot of bars and cafes. Cheap shopping. Best place to try the local food and drinks."
ChIJp0o4Er6rNTERjlTif_IXU1k,Really nice place to visit and stay. A lot of activities from day all the way till night. Worth the visit if you are here in Hanoi.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Stepping into Hoa Lo Prison was like walking back in time. The dark cells, heavy doors, and detailed exhibits created a somber atmosphere that really conveyed the weight of its history. The information throughout was clear and engaging, making the stories of the past feel vivid and real. It wasn’t crowded during my visit, so I could wander quietly and reflect, spending about an hour inside. The entry fee was very reasonable for such a powerful experience. With half the site outdoors and little air conditioning inside, the heat added to the intensity of the visit. A haunting yet unforgettable stop in Hanoi."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,Situated in the city and easy to reach from the old quarters. Only a small portion of the original facility remained. Lots of exhibits showing the history and condition of the prisoners and we were able to walk into the cells as well. Worth a visit if you have never visited a prison.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"I visited Hoa Lo Prison in Hanoi and paid 50,000 VND for the entrance. I didn’t get the audio guide since many of the exhibits already have clear explanations in English. It was very interesting to see and learn about the history of the prison and what life was like for both Vietnamese and American prisoners. The displays are well organized and give a deep look into an important part of Vietnam’s past. Definitely worth visiting if you enjoy history."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Must do experience! This museum is in the actual prison, very informative & well presented  showing the last 100 years of war. Entry fee was cheap. Good rainy or half day activity. Although we did in about 1.5hrs.
We caught a tuktuk from Old Quarter and it was great.
They have a good audio guide incl. some recordings of actual Veterans for a price - don't bother with it if you don't mind reading what you're interested in (English, Vietnamese)."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Definitely worth a visit if you want to learn about Vietnam’s history during the French occupation and the Vietnam War. The displays are eye opening and tell the story really well. It is sad to see how prisoners were kept shackled before execution, but it gives real perspective on what they went through. A powerful place to visit and highly recommended."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Visited the Hoa Lo prison on a Sunday, it was a bit crowded but the tour was fun and worth it.
Paid 50 000 VND for entry and got the audio guide for 100 000 VND , I was happy to get the audio guide because even though you can read about the different parts of the tour, the crowd would stand around the display and it would have been difficult to get close enough to read.
I was a bit reluctant to visit but really glad I did. Learned a lot about Vietnam’s history in relation with the prison also called by the U.S. POW the Hanoi Hilton !"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Very interesting and well presented history lesson, especially for those of us who don’t know much of Vietnam’s history. Audio guide is well done. The museum was crowded but we went on a holiday so we chose a bad day to visit."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Wow. Experiencing something like this creates a whole new chapter in your life. Understanding how people experienced this gave me a diff sense of life and meaning. The exhibitions gave you a real feel of how it was back then, real examples/stories and actual exhibits put you through it mentally and physically.
No one should go thru life like that, but history is what it is. The location is easy to spot, lots of people, but more than enough space to take your time to learn a part of history that many would never double click into. It’s amazing, life-enhancing and a story that we all should learn about :) and the staff was AWESOME despite the heat and the number of tourists they had to manage. Thank you! :)"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"One of the experiences I looked forward to the most before going to Hanoi was visiting Hoa Lo Prison, and it didn't disappoint. The museum is thoroughly educational and really gives you a sense of what life was like there, and shares a lot about those who were imprisoned there from French colonial rule, until during the duration of the Vietnamese-American War.

I have to say that the Vietnamese truly do have deep commitment to and extreme talent in preserving these historical artifacts and turning them into an educational experience. Not all countries or cultures are this invested in taking the trauma and turmoil from their past and turning it into a lesson. It's been two weeks since we came home from Vietnam and I still find myself thinking about the displays there: the clothes used by prisoners, the torture items, the stories we read. It was extremely eye-opening and reminded me of the effects of war on us all.

At the end of the exhibit, you can light an incense stick for the soul of those who passed during the war, and those who passed in Hoa Lo Prison.

There is an option to get a human guide or an audio guide, but we opted to go without either. It was still an educational experience. Tickets were 50k dong I think, and you would need an hour and a half to soak up the whole exhibit."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"If anyone asked me to recommend the best museum in Hanoi, this is the one. I really enjoyed exploring and learning dark history of the prisoners. It was a very comprehensive history experience."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,Highly recommend coming here if you are at all interested in war/criminal history. We went around 1 pm on a Friday and it was pretty busy. I saw a few English speaking visitors being disrespectful which was pretty upsetting. There is a sign outside of the building stating some of the exhibits are closed so be aware of that.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Once a prison now converted to museum

Originally built by French colonists for local revolutionaries.

Then used by Vietnamese to held us war prisoners.

This museum is well organised and maintained.

It mostly displays the recreated environment of torture and bad conditions of Vietnamese prisoners by French.

There are various sections of the museum

There are screens giving a vedio presentation about museum and subject it displayed

There is also a memorial built to pay tribute in the courtyard of prison.

A section also displays about the period when us soilderd were held as POW.

This place is tickted

It will take more than an hour to visit this museum"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,Went there during a weekday afternoon there were a lot of people including young children.  Adult tickets cost 50k and audio guide cost 100k. Definitely need the audio guide to truly take in the experience. It is haunting reminder that freedom is not free for the coming generations of Vietnamese seeing peace in their time.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,The audio guide is definitely a must try! It will greatly add more context and experience to the whole trip. This was such a great experience. You'll love this if you are a history buff and if not you will learn more and appreciate the Vietnamese people and their history.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"It was a fascinating and even shocking experience — the audio guide didn’t just explain things, it brought them to life through sound effects and atmosphere. It felt like being transported into another time and place. A must attraction for the tourist!"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"A Profound Journey Through Vietnam’s History

Visiting Hoa Lo Prison was a deeply moving experience. The museum offers a stark and powerful glimpse into Vietnam’s turbulent past, from its days under French colonial rule to the Vietnam War. Walking through the preserved cells and exhibits, I was struck by the resilience and courage of those who endured unimaginable hardships within these walls. The displays are informative and thought-provoking, providing insight into the struggles for independence and the complexities of war. It’s a sobering reminder of the cost of freedom and the strength of the human spirit. A must-visit for anyone seeking to understand Vietnam’s rich and challenging history."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"It was a nice visit to learn about the history of Vietnam! Audio guide is quite pricey but considering the amount of informations it holds, it can be useful. The complex of the prison is quite big and some rooms really have detailed explanations. I suggest you to take audio guide if you’re coming here so all things seen can be understood well. They even had the execution thing they used before. It was very sad to see but important to really learn about it. All in all, an interesting visit! You could get by with part of the city tour bus - hop on hop off or you can just come straight away here, which what we did on our first day exploring Hanoi. It’s not too far from Old Quarter area if you don’t mind walking around"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Really informative. Insightful and grounding. Tickets are 50k, the whole experience takes about 1.5-2hours. I’d recommend if you’re visiting Hanoi and enjoy learning about Vietnams history. Some rooms have air conditioning so it’s an escape from the heat as well."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"The horrors of a past that must never be forgotten. A reminder of the atrocities the Vietnamese’s endured and the survival instinct, that turned adversity into strength. Visit it to get a glimpse of history that is not so distant. The horrors of war."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,An important and moving historical site. Well-maintained with detailed exhibits that give deep insight into Vietnam’s history. A must-visit for anyone wanting to understand the country’s past
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Ist a nice Museum. I have reach it at 12:00, in hope there are not so much people. But there was very many people so it gets uncomfortable. When you have time and space to watch and read ore heare everithing you can spent an hour.
When you swimm with many people trough 10min. I recommend not expecting too much"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"This was the best museum we visited during our trip through Vietnam, traveling from the south to the north. The audio guide completely captivated our whole family—including our two children (ages 12 and 9)—from start to finish.

I can’t recommend the audio guide enough—it made the experience at least ten times more engaging than simply reading the display texts. It costs 100,000 VND to hire and is absolutely worth it in my opinion.

The history shared was fascinating—from the French design choices made to ensure the prison’s longevity, to the powerful stories of political detainees who continued to inspire hope. One especially moving part was learning how imprisoned women secretly saved materials to create crafts to sell, using the proceeds to help fellow inmates—without the prison authorities even realizing.

A truly eye-opening piece of Hanoi’s history. Don’t miss this museum if you’re in the city!"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"An important part of Vietnam’s history 🇻🇳
The museum offers a good overview, and about half an hour is enough for a short visit. The entrance fee is 50,000 VND."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Fascinating museum explaining the history.  It's 50,000 D for entry. The exhibition gives you a hint of what life may have been like
The memorial garden I found emotional"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"This museum ambiance is well made and it's easily understandable for french and english people.
It relates to French colonialism with its impact on Vietnamese people that were imprisoned and how those organized their revolution to get their freedom.
There is also a part of the fight related to the defense against American imperialism, especially against aircraft. Can understand why patriotism so important to Vietnamese.
50k/person, highly recommended!"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Went on 1 June, quite a lot of other foreigners as well. Was able to learn about the history of the prison, and the actions the various cruel actions that were used to the prisoners. Made us realise the importance of humanity.

Didn't hire a guide or rent an audio guide, as am able to read the English words that were made present on most boards."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,We loved this historical experience. Having the guided tour via Headphones was great. We learnt so much and appreciate the stories that were shared.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"It was very informative and it has altered my perception of the Vietnamese people who treated their captors so well despite the millions who were killed by them, they did not have food to eat but served american breakfast to their captors. The literature on display and the videos shared were detailed, the washrooms were clean and free. However it could not handle huge crowd of visitors."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Really interesting, informative self guided tour. Tickets can be bought at the box office right outside the gate for 50k vnd. An audio guide is available to purchase for 100k vnd upon entering the prison which I'd recommend as an English speaking tourist. Very well laid out, easy to follow, plenty of opportunities to sit down and rest as you make your way around the prison. Highly recommend visiting."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,An eye opening experience and a sad reminder of what we can do to each other. Exhibition was smaller than we expected but the cover charge was also less in comparison with other such exhibits.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"It’s truly worth a visit.
You can feel the oppressive atmosphere and the heavy emotions within the prison, which leave a deep impression.
Being inside allows you to reflect and find a different kind of emotional outlet.
Highly recommended as part of your trip!"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Hỏa Lò Prison (Hanoi, Vietnam) — Built by the French in 1896 to house Vietnamese political prisoners, this grim colonial jail later became infamous during the Vietnam War when captured U.S. pilots were held here and nicknamed it the “Hanoi Hilton.” Today, only part of the original prison remains, preserved as a museum. Visitors can walk through eerie cells, see escape tunnels, and learn the stories of both Vietnamese revolutionaries and American POWs — a stark reminder of the resilience and suffering of those who passed through its gates."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Visited on a Monday around 2 pm, no queues at all. Ticket was 50,000 VND. Very interesting place with lots of history, definitely worth a stop in Hanoi!"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Really good museum with information in English, French and Vietnamese.

We didn’t book in advance, you can get tickets easily from the Kiosk by the entrance.

Took us around an hour to get around it which covered the Prisions early history with the French imprisoning Vietnamese revolutionaries and the more modern history of American Pilots being held here once their planes had been shot down.

Gave a real sense of the oppression that the Vietnamese people have fought against over the years. Very well run museum and would recommend 100%"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Very interesting museum to visit, 50,000 VND entry and 100,000 VND for the audio guide but the displays were interesting and detailed enough without it, it does provide some interesting background information, quite crowded when I visited so had to wait sometimes to get a good look at the displays, definitely worth visiting when in Hanoi"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Hoa Lo Prison is informative and provides great historical insights of its use in the past and during the Vietnam war.

The artefacts are mostly accompanied by information boards in Vietnamese, English, and French. There is the option of having and audio guide device at 100k VND per person but it’s not necessary if you can read the boards.

Worth a visit if you are in Hanoi and a history buff! Put aside about 1.5 - 2 hours to full experience the museum."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,This is the 1st audio.tour that I have not skipped one minute. Brilliantly presented. Huge eye opener to the resilience of the Vietnamese people and gave a great understanding to their national pride. Hard not to become emotional at parts.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Hoa Lo Prison
It would be beneficial to take the audio guide but it takes a lot of time to explore the area. It is really interesting to know the history of this iconic prison and I learned a lot about Hanoi itself."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,A brilliant but thought provoking experience- a MUST see in Hanoi to learn about the culture & history of Hanoi. Don’t skip this whilst visiting Hanoi.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,The ticket for children under 16 is free. They have audio device to hear the story of the prison. It is quite well managed with lots of displays and pictures. The path to follow inside the prison is clear and easy. They have souvenir shops inside too
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"It was a very educational visit for us. We learned a lil bit about the French colonization & the Vietnam War and why the prison was also called 'Hanoi Hilton'.

We went to the museum during their Public Holiday so it was quite packed with locals & foreigners. The museum is well-maintained, informative and the descriptions are in 3 languages (English, Vietnamese & French)

Entrance fees was 50k VND and they do provide audio guide for 100K VND for rent"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,Nice place to learn about Vietnam's history. We visited just in time as the country celebrated its 80th independence day. Although humid and smell inside not that well maintained
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Interesting historical prison which documents the times of Vietnam under french colonial times. Artifacts and prison facilities were recreated, telling a grim story about life inside these prisons. There was also a special exhibition documenting the Vietnam War as well. A must-visit if you are into history.

Visited in April 2025."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"The place is historic and worth to go, but you wont understand the exhibits unless you pay for the audio guide (not expensive though). It is a nice place to spend an hour or two."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,Nice place with nice staffs. They help every visitors with their sincere hearts. The audio presenter is a must when coming here if you would like to know about every corner of the relic.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Depicts the history from the French invasion to post the Vietnam War. There are individual prisoner stories throughout and details of the horrific conditions and treatment, political and resistance soldiers (both men and women) were subjected to. There are also stories of American POWs and their stay/captivity at the 'Hanoi Hilton'. We hired the audio head sets for the full experience, but you can also hire a guide to take you around. Thoroughly recommend it is well worth a visit."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,Very interesting museum. Entrance was d50k per person. They have an audioguide (d100k) available in different languages. The route is easy to follow and there is information about everything. I recommend to visit when you’re in or near Hanoi.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,extremely educational and eye opening experience. highly recommend to anyone who likes museums. definitely get the audio guide. my wife and i really enjoyed it and gave us much needed perspective on vietnamese culture
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,Opens early 8am so was able to get in last day b4 airport pick up. Prisons are sad but educational all the same & if your into history ✅ it cost 40d and super clean well organised they have the audio extra cost or can stroll around and take it all in.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Hoa Lo Prison is a deeply moving and educational site, offering a sobering look into Vietnam’s complex history.

The exhibits are powerful, and small details—like the almond tree in the courtyard, once planted and cared for by prisoners—add a human touch that lingers long after you leave.

My only criticism is how crowded it was; the large number of visitors made it hard to fully reflect on the space and its stories. Still, a must-visit—just try to go during quieter hours if you can."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,so amazing to see and feel the history.  It is well planned and people are moved through efficiently whiling allow time to absorb an understanding of the events
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Visiting Hỏa Lò Prison, often called the “Hanoi Hilton,” is a deeply moving experience. The museum offers a raw and honest look into Vietnam’s turbulent past.

It’s not just a tourist site; it’s a place that tells powerful stories of resilience, suffering, and national pride."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,Learnt so much about past treatment of both locals and American POWs at the Hanoi Hilton. The audio tour was well worth purchasing.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"An absolute stop for when you visit Hanoi: something cultural, acquainting yourself to the bloody and strifeful history of Vietnam. Now turned as a museum, you can go on your own pace and relive the horrors of the then prison used by the French colonists; labyrinthine, claustrophobic, informative.  There are souvenir shops inside and you can rent headsets that translate the whole narrative history in different languages for 100k vnd."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Be aware that this museum does not present the full historical picture. It focuses heavily on how American prisoners were treated ""humanely"" by the Vietnamese, while leaving out the well-documented accounts of torture and harsh conditions reported by many former U.S. POWs.

That said, it is still a fascinating and important place to visit. The museum powerfully shows the suffering and resilience of the Vietnamese people during decades of war. I have deep sympathy for what they endured, and it’s a moving reminder of the human cost of conflict — on all sides."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Good overall experience, lotss of reading but some very interesting bits. Well worth a look

Can get a bit cramped as narrow passageways and people reading things stood in the way"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,Really good place to visit. Very interesting to hear about how the place was used and the ingenuity of the inmates in planning escapes amid the cruelty that went on. Also the amazing way messages were brought in and out. Well worth a visit when in Hanoi
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Very interesting museum describing the terrible life conditions of the prisoners during French occupation. We also found the American War section very interesting, bringing another point of view of the cruelty faced by the people of Vietnam.
50 000 vnd is definitely a good price even if it was very crowded.
Possibility to rent an audio guide for 100 000 vnd extra, but the signs provide enough information."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Spooky, gruesome, the uglier side of humanity bought to life in a small but intense tour of what man can do to other men just because they disagree.  Sad, but true to this day.

Worth a couple of hours during your Hà Nội visit"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"History is written by the victors, but no one jailed in this prison was a winner. Worth a visit. Vietnamese jailed by the French had a terrible time.  Read between the lines when viewing the narrative of the American prisoners."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"When visiting Hanoi you might want to consider visiting Hoa Lo Prison, it is really good to know and learn a little bit history of one city/country."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Great museum, quite heavy at parts though. The exhibition is set up nicely, taking you first through some of the old prison blocks, after to a memorial and finalices at a section with a more overarching story of Vietnam’s political state. Would highly recommend if you’re interested in the political dynamics that unfolded here."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Really interesting experience, We were rushed through a bit. I could definitely have spent more time here exploring. Definitely worth checking out if you are interested in war and French colonisation history."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Really interesting and certainly unbiased regarding the Indochina period. As a French visitor, it really moved me. However, I was really disappointed to see that the part relating the American POW story is still under the same propaganda it was during and at the end of the war : there is no mention of torture acts on American soldiers and the story is all about how they were nicely treated (which was mainly staged). Even though it’s obvious that the Vietnamese perception and suffering should be focused on during the visit, I would have prefer a less biaised story telling  (you can see Vietnamese scholars visiting the museum - so I guess that’s what they learn at scholol)
Still an important place to visit - keeping all of this in mind"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,The museum has a heavy energy and you can feel the dense air but it’s so informative and well designed. A very educational experience indeed…
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Great visit to know history of Vietnam. Visited Hanoi many time but first visit for this prison. Horrible and sad place. No one has power to harsh and kill others. As people having simillar pain from Japan, I respect Vietnames warriors.

Worthy to visiting"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,I highly recommend a visit to this if you are a history enthusiast. The museum itself is focused primarily on the French colonial. And there is about 20% devoted to the American war. And when this place was known as the Hanoi Hilton.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Amazing museum with a lot of information and stories that was well presented through text, audio and displays. Lots of shocking details of the cruelty there."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Highly recommend using the audio tour headsets. The tour is eye opening and covers multiple decades of brutal, eye opening history."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,Interesting visit to learn more about the history of Vietnam other than the war. This historical prison has exhibits from the French colonisation and its use for keeping political prisoners.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"If you’re looking for something to do that involves history, I’d recommend coming here. I chose to walk through and read everything myself but I think for the full immersive experience, you should get one of those audio devices (though, it seems like it might have been hard to hear with all the tour groups happening at once). Although I enjoyed getting to learn about this prison’s history, I wish they really went into the details/horrors of the lives of people here. But maybe that was explained in the audio devices? I’m not sure, but it definitely felt like basic info if you just read through their labels. Another thing I wished they did was have a translation for all the letters and correspondence. Would’ve been cool to actually understand more of what was said besides the summarized idea. Regardless, still cool to enter n experience for the cost of 50k. Maybe next time I’ll use the audio lol"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,Very informative prison museum that showed the life's of the prisoners in the past. There are life size models depicting how prisoners were treated. Note that it might be too dark/unsettling for younger children.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"TLDR; cultural hotspot, easily 2-3 hours of content, slow paced activity, slightly immersive

As one who needs a shot of cultural education during his travels, this was a must-do for me. The subject matter can be quite heavy since it talks about maltreatment of political prisoners and deaths during war time. However, there’s a good balance of highlighting the power of resistance that was shown through the arts, tools, press and even public speech. A key feature of the exhibition are the real accounts of prisoners, friends of, and witnesses of the time that intertwine the audio guide.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND to get the audio guide, it’s easy to use and disinfected when it gets to you. Light and portable. A good mid-day activity to rest in the shade/indoors with a number of good air con spots."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Hoa Lo Prison Museum is a fascinating and at times very intense place to visit. As a first-time tourist in Vietnam, I found it both informative and emotional, giving a deep look into the country’s history. The museum shows what life was like for Vietnamese prisoners during the French colonial period and later for American soldiers during the Vietnam War.

A large part of the exhibitions focus on communist revolutionary prisoners, their struggles, teaching, escapes, and the revolts that took place inside the prison. The top floor highlights famous revolutionary figures and lists the names of many who were imprisoned here. Personally, I felt this section was a bit too heavy on political propaganda, but it is still an important perspective of the history.

The entry price is reasonable. If you go, I strongly recommend paying extra for the audio guide. Many items are not explained with signs, and the guide really brings context and stories to life. Just note that it uses a wired headset (not AirPods or Bluetooth), so sharing one between two people is not possible.

Visiting on a weekday, it was not very crowded, which made the experience even more engaging and easier to take in."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"An outstanding display of the 100 year history of the prison. Very informative displays and artifacts from when the French used the facility to imprison and torture Vietnamese revolutionaries. Also very informative of its use by the Vietnamese as the ""Hanoi Hilton"" to imprison downed American pilots. (No mention of their torture.) The museum contains a tear jerking memorial to the fallen civilians of the 12 day bombing campaign of Hanoi by Nixon in 1972.

This is a place every American should see and wonder how did our politicians allow this to happen."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Hoa Lo Prison is a must visit if you are in Hanoi.

It is a very sobering and immersive experience about the lives of Vietnamese, and later American, prisoners held there.

It had a lot of artefacts on show. There are audio guides in most languages and the displays boards are also written in both Vietnamese and English.

You are free to walk round the prison at your own speed. It took us 90 minutes.

It’s cheap to get into and there was no queue when we went.

I would defiantly go back - four stars."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Expected much more from Hoa Lo Prison. Way too crowded, hard to walk through and not very well organised. Some parts were interesting, but overall the experience felt rushed and uncomfortable. Could be much better with better crowd management."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Fascinating museum .. really interesting information well presented not just about the history of the prison but the historical context in which it was operated .. starting with the French colonisation of Vietnam, opening the prison in around 1800 )and having to constantly expand it as they imprisoned more & more Vietnamese people fighting for freedom…. ) and continuing through to its use to imprison US pilots shot down during the Vietnam war ( when it became known as the ‘Hanoi Hilton’)

Very moving memorial wall"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,One of the best things I have done! Highly recommend for those visiting Hanoi. The place is highly maintained and there were not that much people visiting when we went. The whole experience was very informative and immersive. Will definitely visit again when we come back to Vietnam!
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"One of the few places that is worth visiting.
The ticket price is quite low at 50,000.
The prison museum is ok . Nothing of special but Vietnam USA war museum was really good."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Learn a lot about the history of Vietnam here. Got goosebumps and almost burst into tears for so many time. Came for the hype, but love the place for the history it actually carries.
Totally recommend spending 50k for the audio device, the content is really well prepared and super engaging."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,This is a must see if you visit Hanoi. Part of the original prison still stands whilst other parts have been rebuilt. The history and stories are interesting and important. Get the audio guide if you visit - it helps to tell the story and appreciate what happened to the Vietnamese prisoners and the American prisoners who were jailed here.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"This was a moving experience and rich with history. The museum is well taken care of and easy to navigate. I definitely recommend getting an audio tour device, it added a lot of first hand accounts and details about each section of the museum. Keep the receipt! They want it back when you return the device."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Hoa Lo Prison – A Place of Profound Historical Significance

Hoa Lo Prison, often referred to as the “Hanoi Hilton” during the Vietnam War, holds undeniable historical importance. A visit here offers a sobering and thought-provoking look into Vietnam’s tumultuous past, spanning from its colonial struggles against the French to the Vietnam War. However, the quality of the experience largely depends on how you choose to engage with the museum.

To truly appreciate the depth of this site, I strongly recommend using the audio guide. It allows you to explore the exhibits at your own pace, immersing yourself in the narratives of those who lived, fought, and suffered here. The stories of the Vietnamese revolutionaries who endured brutal conditions under French colonial rule and the American POWs held during the war are presented with a balance of emotional resonance and factual depth. The audio guide adds nuance to the exhibits, enriching your understanding of the prison’s dual role as a symbol of resilience and propaganda.

That said, the experience can be diminished by large tourist groups with guides. The confined nature of the former cells and hallways becomes overwhelming when crowded, and the noise from these groups can disrupt the solemn atmosphere that this site deserves. For this reason, I recommend planning your visit during off-peak hours or using noise-canceling headphones to stay immersed in the experience.

The museum itself is well-curated, with artifacts such as letters, photographs, and personal items that humanize the historical accounts. The juxtaposition of the harrowing French colonial period and the more politically complex Vietnam War era invites visitors to reflect on the layers of history embedded within this site.

While Hoa Lo Prison may not offer the grandeur of larger historical sites, its emotional and intellectual weight makes it a must-visit for those interested in understanding Vietnam’s history. Approach it with curiosity, sensitivity, and a willingness to delve into the difficult realities of the past, and you’ll find it to be a deeply rewarding experience."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"The museum layout is well organised, but it can get pretty crowded esp with big organised tours."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"I really enjoyed visiting this museum, it shows us how difficult life could be there during the french colonialists era"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"It's a great museum, we really get to step into history which is very touching.
Don't hesitate if you pass by!
We paid around €1.75 for the adult ticket."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,Visiting this place is an intense experience. The history is explained quite well with exhibits that give you a good sense of the depravity the (mostly political) prisoners were subjected to. The American POWS (e.g. Shot down in B52 bombers) were also kept here for a short while. They were the ones to give this place its nickname of the Hanoi Hilton.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"It was the first time I visited a historical site like this, and it was such an educative visit.
I learned a lot about the prisoners’ lives, their unfathomably horrible living conditions, along with the prison’s history dating back from the French Colonialism to the 60s when the American was bombing the Northern Vietnam. There were also many historical specimens and photographs to see, which gave me chills.
You should definitely check this place out when visiting Ha Noi."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Very good museum. Audio guide is available in multiple languages, however the signs are all in vietnamese and English so it is very easy to understand. Entry price is very reasonable."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Very informative.
Amazing resilient people.
On walking into the prison was a very welcoming group of people offering headphones and audio to listen to as you walked around  for a small price
I chose not to use headphones .
As I walked around  the prison in my opinion there was enough visuals  to understand  what was happening
If you learnt anything at school about this war
Please come and see what you may or may not of learnt"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"A deeply moving and eye-opening experience. The museum is well laid out, with clear explanations in English and Vietnamese, and the audio guide adds powerful personal stories to the history. Walking through the old cells, seeing original artifacts, and learning about both the French colonial era and the Vietnam War was sobering yet fascinating. Highly recommend visiting early in the day for a quieter, more reflective experience. An important stop in Hanoi for anyone wanting to understand the country’s past."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Hoa Lo Prison is a must-visit if you're in Hanoi and want to understand the country's modern history. The museum is well-curated, with emotional displays about the harsh conditions Vietnamese revolutionaries endured under French colonial rule. The contrast with the American POW section is striking. It’s not just a museum—it’s a reminder of resilience, struggle, and survival. Give yourself at least an hour to take it all in."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Really cool place, would definitely recommend, such an interesting place to learn about Vietnam during french occupation and the Vietnam war!!"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,Must try tourist area in Hanoi! It was depressing to see visit this place but also important to be knowledgeable about the culture.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,A very heart-breaking experience! The entire exhibition is massive (we spent about 1.5 hours there). Definitely worth a visit if you’re big into history!
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Very unsettling place, gave lots of food for thought. Recommend to go just to broaden your views on Vietnam during and after the war."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,Interesting place you can learn a lot about the history of vietnam. I would recommend getting the audio guide as the signs weren't that informative. We were here on a tuesday and there was no cue at all.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"A historical place that actually allow visitors to have immersive experience, to learn history. Definitely recommended, the team managing this historical place did a great job in showcasing visitor the history of the prison."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"This is definitely the “must go to” museum in Hanoi. With the audioguide, which is really good, you need approx 2-3 hours.

Bonus points for ventilation and AC in the exhibition rooms.

But try to keep an sceptic mind and factcheck with other sources."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"It could get crowded but having a booked tour makes the whole thing faster.
Inside, it is amazing how they were able to preserve a rich part of their history.

Now we learned some of the reason why the people are very resilient."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Really nice to understand about vietnamese history, which in europe (at least in Italy) I never studied."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"The Hỏa Lò Prison Museum (“Hanoi Hilton”) is an important and deeply moving historical site. The exhibits are thoughtfully arranged and give valuable insight into Vietnam’s colonial and wartime history. Visiting this place leaves a strong impression and helps to understand the complexity of that period.

However, it is regrettable that the narrative presented about the treatment of prisoners of war does not fully reflect historical reality. The museum suggests that all captives were treated humanely, yet documented evidence shows otherwise.

A striking example is Monika Schwinn (who is mentioned prominently in the museum), a German nurse working for a humanitarian organization to help the suffering local civilians in South Vietnam. In 1969, she and four colleagues were abducted by Vietcong forces; three of them died within the first weeks of captivity. Despite Schwinn’s clear status as medical personnel protected under the Geneva Conventions, she and the surviving doctor Bernhard Diehl were detained for years in this very prison and held hostage— a measure clearly contrary to international law. The museum’s story on how well she was treated even allowing her to have a cat is a mockery of the inhuman treatment she suffered.

While the museum is well worth visiting, it would gain much in credibility and educational value if it also acknowledged such documented violations and presented a more balanced account of history."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Very moving exhibit.  This museum tells a very important and very sad  history of Vietnam people, the  autrocities of the French and the Vietnam War."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Very well displayed. Get audioguide, its really worth it. Will learn a lot here about revolutionary period of vietnamese people as well as the vietnam war."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"It's a historical place, a must-see place when you're in Hanoi. The staff was super friendly and helpful to introduce me to their services, the shows and other things. You  can pay cash or transfer money to their accounts. After getting it, you should stop at the first table to let them stamp on your hand. The words mean you're inside that prison together. Along the way to different areas of the prison, you can listen to the main points of the historical things, people and places. It  was a very interesting trip back to the past but also it made people feel sad about what happened during the war. At the end of the trip, you should stop at the bang tree to know its message to you and try the tea and milk tea made from bang leaves. The trees are historical and they experienced everything with the prisoners. If you want to see the night show, you should book it in advance. I recommend booking the show at least 2 months before your trip via their facebook page."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Interesting museum, not too expensive 100,000 dong to get in and same again to get audio guude which was useful but not essential as plenty of information throughout the tour."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"It was okay. Tickets are not expensive so worth a visit if you’re interested, but nothing amazing (in terms of a ‘museum’ experience).

The stories of the political prisoners is very interesting and they do have English translations for important things.

I didn’t get the audio guide but in hindsight I think it could have made the experience better. Although it is 3x entry price (150k)."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,Interesting to see and walk through. I would recommend getting audio guide as I didn’t and not a lot of info in English. But if saving money it’s still good to do without audio guide.
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"This was actually one of the highlights of Hanoi for me! Very informative and very cool place. It is well managed. I’d save 2 hours away for this, it’s much bigger than i thought it would be."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,Very good displays definitely worth it's time to walk about
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"What a deeply moving and fascinating site. The Hoa Lo Prison was originally a prison owned by the French to imprison the Vietnamese. I loved seeing the places where they escaped through the tunnels. During the Vietnam War with America, the prison became a prison to hold the Americans. The exhibits were so well layed out and easy to read. Truly a must visit in Hanoi!"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Hỏa Lò Prison  nickname ""Hanoi Hilton"" was a prison in Hanoi originally used by the French colonists in Indochina for political prisoners, and later by North Vietnam. The museum is by no means big and can easily covered in half a day. However, some areas of the section are space restricted and this can cause significant claustrophobic to some visitors. Nonetheless, the visits provide some significant details of both the men and women prisons."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"The best 50k you will spend in hanoi. Really well done museum, lots to see and read. Audio guides available, and everything well directed. Staff are super helpful too. Such a great way to learn about Vietnam history, quite harrowing but definitely worth a visit."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"It a great place to know the history of this lovely country. It’s really sad to see and know how they were tortured by the occupiers.
Because of all those who paid a price (even unto their death) this generation is enjoying the freedom.
God bless the freedom fighters."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Pretty grim place. But what else could it be to showcase the horror of the French colonialist  on the Vietnamese?

Audio guides available at the front with people helping with instructions etc.

Very good depictions of conditions and some extra stuff on the American bombing of Hanoi and the subsequent imprisonment of US pilots that were shot down and captured. Their treatment was first class compared to french/vietnamese.

Like most places, go early and you'll miss the tour bus crowds"
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Fascinating and harrowing. The amount of cruelty to the (political) prisoners is shocking.
I strongly recommend you take the audio tour to get the full benefit of the visit."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Excellent find, very good decor and drinks selection. Great value for money. Would 100% recommend."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"A must-see experience. This museum was high on my list of things to do in Hoy, but I didn't anticipate how much I would enjoy it. The exhibits provided an overwhelming amount of information about the war and the horrific conditions prisoners endured. The prison relics, in particular, were profoundly impactful, offering a dark reminder of the past. Walking through some of the spaces was intense and deeply moving. I felt truly honored to witness this history firsthand. I highly recommend the audio tour—it's well worth the extra fee."
ChIJld5RqparNTERVK8x7gvhAZc,"Meaningful place with plenty of history.
It was great that here had bit many English explanations"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"The experience was nice overall, but the museum itself was really small, with only about 8–10 rooms, each featuring different lighting effects. It felt a bit overpriced for the size, but still something interesting to see. What really surprised me was that it was restricted to Generation Z only, meaning only visitors between 12 and 22 years old were allowed. I’ve honestly never experienced something like that before, which made the visit quite unique, even if a little unusual."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"We randomly stepped into the Illusion Museum, and it turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip. The museum has around 7–8 sections, each one more exciting than the last. Our son absolutely loved the experience, and we managed to click so many fun and creative pictures.

It’s a great spot where you can easily spend 1–2 hours enjoying the illusions and interactive setups. The entry was around 200K VND per person (don’t recall the exact amount), and it felt completely worth it. A must-visit if you’re looking for something entertaining and different!"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"It was beautiful! We went there on a Friday night around 8pm and we were the only two people mostly so it was an amazing visit. We paid 230,000 per person for the ticket."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Worth checking out if you want to get some cute videos or photos. The cost was about 200k per person which some might consider expensive. We went during the week and were the only customers so we had every exhibit to ourselves. A pretty neat immersive experience and there is a Photo Booth at the end!
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Amazing experience! I loved it, reasonable and fun. Opportunity yo dress up in traditional wear and take pics. Inside a stunning mall in the heart of the old 1/4."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"So expensive. We paid 250k/pers on saturday, rooms are very small. Whole thing lasted 30/45min depends if you take many pictures or not. Doesn't worth the money"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Not worth it. Entry fees is around 250000vnd per pax. It has few fees projectors with video playing and showing on the reflections. Only can kids can love it and not adult.
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Good experience but the ticket is a bit expensive for foreigners. But u can also try free selfie 🤳
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Compared to other artsy things in Hanoi kinda expensive. You can spent 20 minutes inside and experience nice sounddesign and videos. I think it’s more for children
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"This museum was great! It’s a little hidden but you can find it at the top floor of the shopping mall. The people working there were extremely friendly and explained everything. There are cool things to do such as taking pictures of yourself at different destinations, see your own drawing come to live and become truly one with nature 😄. If you’re after an immersive experience you should go here!"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,We were enthusiastic about the museum. We took a lot of nice photos and we liked it there. We recommend this to others.
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Likes the idea .
It's small but nice ."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"A really cool and modern way to explore art, much more interesting with audio guides and AR features. The staff were friendly. Great for both locals and tourists!"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Superb experience. Loved it. It is an attraction meant for all ages. Serene and calm atmosphere. All the visual arts are superb and worth the price. Also they have a new Korean style photo booth at the end where you can click photos. Clicking photos is for free and you can even download the soft copy of the photos for free. However they wud charge you for the print of the photos. The youth at the counter are quite nice as well. However,buy tickets from klook. They are slightly cheaper than the tickets at the counter."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Cool place.
I would say worth the money, it lasts around an hour.
Some really interesting displays in some rooms."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Good for kids, takes about 10 mins to walk through the whole place without stopping. Price is 230000 Dong"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"I suggest you to go through 1 time, then do not get out - go to the opposite direction. By that less people will stand into your photos and you got more idea of what to do"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"It’s at the 5th floor of Trang Tien Plaza, right behind the Korean BBQ restaurant. A thorough multimedia art museum."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Good experience nice place. 1 time should be visit there.
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Good place for family with kids
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,It was great. It was located on the fifth floor of the plaza. Such a luxurious plaza
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Incredibly underwhelming, if you like to pay 180k/$7 per person to be cramped in a tiny space with a lot of kids and instagram ladies, viewing artificial, zero-taste design projections on the wall, visit i-museum.

We spent about 30 minutes to go through the whole thing. The 3D projections of nature like garden, vietnam sea, thác bản giốc all look so artificially design, and make you feel like they took some free 3D design from Shutterstock. The best part (as you might have guessed from viewing their photos and social media) is the vincent van gogh/art exhibition room, but you can tell the person who made the 3D design have no idea about the art they are exhibiting at all, the animations are purely ""slideshow animations"" than anything.

Not to mention there is barely any music, it's terribly crowded with noisy kids and instagram ladies so good luck getting a good spot to view the show."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"It seems like this place markets itself as a museum but delivers a subpar experience. From the description, it appears to be nothing more than a series of projectors displaying low-quality art, which doesn’t justify the ticket price of 250 VND—especially when compared to the cost of a proper meal at a good restaurant. The disappointment is evident, as the visitor expected a richer, more immersive experience but instead found it to be a waste of both time and money. If you’re looking for a true museum experience with real exhibits, this might not be the right place."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Admission was expensive compared to the really short viewing time, but it's worth visiting at least once. I recommend watching 5-7 years old."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"We went there with families kids like it too much, the price is ok, it’s only 10 minutes to finish the view, it’s ok to visit if you have extra time in Hanoi .location inside the mall"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Disappointing. It's not really an immersive museum but rather a few backgrounds for Instagram photos... Not worth the ticket price.
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"If you haven't been to a similar venue, this place might be really interesting for you. As I have seen a couple of these places, I have to say this is not one of the better ones.

Being immersive: Many rooms have mirrors. Even if you are alone in a room, you see yourself a dozen times (mirrors in mirrors), which made me uncomfortable - you are alone but you don't feel so. Mirrors at the ceiling are also quite counter-intuitive when something is dropping/flowing down, as it then flows up. And having different illustrations / timings next to each other is annoying when there's only one audio channel and you are in front of a illustration that is not in sync with audio.

Regarding content: Unfortunately, it's quite off. There's a wall with water / a beach, but the waves behave unnatural. There's a van Gogh room which has not only van Gogh elements but also at least Klimt and maybe some other artist that painted persons more realistically. I could not identify an overall concept of the museum other than ""look what fancy scenes we can project to walls"".

The one thing I really liked was coloring animals with crayons and then scanning them to be part of an interactive Illustration.

All in all, it was an ok visit, as we had to spend some time before going to the airport, but I would not recommend visiting this place in favor of some other activities."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,this place advertises itself as a “museum” but it is not.  only projectors with “cute” images meant mostly for kids.
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"A really fun place to spend a while during a rainy day or when in need for something a bit different. A great place to take fun photos and enjoy a meditative moment by coloring your own fantasy animal. Suitable for both kids and adults.

Located at the highest floor of Trang Tien Plaza mall. The price is 200k per visitor which is maybe comparatively a bit high and the museum is not very large compared to similar places in other cities in Vietnam, but I enjoyed visiting this place a lot. It offers a good place to escape the busy streets for a moment.

No need to buy tickets in advance, really calm museum so you can just walk into the reception."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,It was an interesting visit.  Went in without knowing much but liked the experience. You can take pictures there and color various animals that appear on the screen. It was fun. You can also see real-time animations with your movements.
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Awful, just truly awful - a complete waste of money simply don’t go.

Unimpressive and dull experience that I really wish we hadn’t wasted time on but it looked cool and similar to some artist type immersive experiences which were great - it wasn’t

Rob"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Nice experience - take your time, immerse yourself in each room and don’t rush - about 5 rooms in total. A little price - about 250k per adult."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Not that many rooms but I thought it was cool, there’s beanie bags so it’s a good place to rest for a bit"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"🛗Take a lift and go to 5th floor and you’ll be at I-Museum.

🏢At the entrance, there is a small sign of I-Museum. But then when you enter inside, you have to ask people where is I-Museum‼️Otherwise we couldn’t find it.

🤯Second, when we enter a stuff was unfriendly and said that foreigners are charged 200 000 VND and Vietnamese 160 000 VND, but no where was written (even on Facebook or where they sell tickets)‼️

🪧 not much English instructions

👘When you want to try a KOREAN costume (not VIETNAMESE 🤣) and take a pictures they will charge you 40 000 VND.
Not visibly seen the price sign - so be careful."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Well worth a visit if your into art.
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Extremely underwhelming.
Not worth the money."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"It is tremendously expensive for what it is. Only 4-5 rooms to see. It is done in 15"""
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Bit expensive for tickets considering it takes about 10 minutes to slowly walk through the whole thing, good for kids, not worth for adults."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Wonderful, all sorts to see. Very immersive and entertaining for something to do for an hour or so."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Great visual experience and interactive.
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Doesn't cost worth it. Just few small rooms. Takes like 10 min
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"It is in last floor of Trang Thieng Plaza, appears in wrong place in the map. Its ok, but small"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Great for small children and selfish. A little too shallow to call it a museum.
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Many good photospots, interactive games for kids"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,It  not worth the money and the place look not too nice
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,history 😍
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Beautiful but only 6 rooms so quite expensive
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Fun, visually stimulating museum for younger kids."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Nice place to visit in the city,"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Not baby friendly
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,A wonderful experience
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Mesmerizing!
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"i have no idea how they get 4/5 star.
Completely disappointed, screen errors,the ceiling is too low (about 2m5 or shorter from the floor). And the worst thing is, the quality and quantity of pictures are so poor, only 1-2 slide to show. Complete the show only took 5-7 mins."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Introduced as the first multi-sensory museum in Vietnam. A quite interesting experience with 6 rooms. The room area is small, the weekend ticket price is a bit high, 200k for adults, probably due to the location on the shore of Hanoi lake. Each room takes about 5-10 minutes to see because the scene changes continuously."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"I-MUSEUM is a multi-sensory art museum that is attracting many people to check in. Because when coming here, visitors will have experiences that they cannot expect.

The check-in location is also very convenient when the museum is located on the 5th floor of Trang Tien Plaza Shopping Center, right next to Hoan Kiem Lake. What makes I-Museum attract many people to visit and experience while entertainment activities are almost saturated, especially in the central area."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"It's just a projector that projects animations onto mirrored walls. It's boring and kindergarten in general. Spending 180k on a ticket that's twice as expensive as a movie ticket is such a pain. After 10 minutes, I was bored 🤣🤣"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Small-scale project mapping👍️
It's good for a casual visit.

I-MUSEUM is Vietnam's first ""Media & Art Museum"" located in Trang Tiên Plaza, a high-end commercial facility in the center of Hanoi. It features five themed spaces where you can experience digital video art with light and sound effects. For example, there are participatory exhibits where you can enter the world of Van Gogh's ""Starry Night"" and create original colorful animals with 3D mapping. In addition, the photo booth where you can take photos wearing traditional Vietnamese and Korean costumes is also popular, so you can enjoy an art experience and commemorative photos at the same time. The museum is open from 9:30 to 21:30, and the admission fee is 230,000 VND for adults and 150,000 VND for children.

Is it enough to see it once?
The admission fee is a bit high, but that's a problem."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Located near Hoan Kiem Lake, it's a great place to cool off and relax.
The themed spaces aren't large, but the mirrors make them feel relatively spacious.
It's great for children, but there are also many older visitors.
It's a place where you can relive your childhood and find a moment of healing amidst the hustle and bustle of everyday life."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
A real highlight – art on a whole new level!
We went there as a group and had an incredible time. It's the perfect way to escape the midday heat and get creative. There are many exciting options: from trying on traditional Vietnamese evening wear to creating your own works of art. Everything is lovingly designed and invites you to participate. Highly recommended for groups, families, or anyone who wants to experience art in a different way!"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Quite interesting, however the ticket price is a bit high compared to the experience. The room height and projection are not very high so it is difficult to take 3:4 vertical shots, not to mention 9:16"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,I-Museum is located in Trang Tien Plaza. Tickets are also not cheap. Use mirrored walls to expand the space. Overall quite interesting. Ticket prices should be reduced so you should experience it.
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"The exhibition is very wow, should go during the week to have more space to enjoy the art, suitable for healing 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"At first, we had to search a bit, as the museum is located on the 5th floor of a luxury mall.

For an entrance fee of around €7.50, the museum is a bit small and doesn't offer much variety. There are several rooms with very nice light installations/projections, some accompanied by music (unfortunately with poor sound quality), and a room with interactive elements. But if you visit the huge, extremely informative, and beautifully designed Ethnological Museum instead, you'll pay just under half the price, including the round-trip Grab taxi ride."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"It's normal, nothing special. If you have kids, you can let them draw so parents can get more time off. But for me, it's small, just a picture projected on the wall. It takes 10 minutes to finish, so it's expensive according to some people, including me, who paid more than 200k."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Unacceptable, the space is not outstanding, the price is high. The ticket policy for tour guides is extremely poor, I brought guests and because there were not enough 10 people, I was kicked out!"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Tickets bought online will be a little cheaper.
Not too crowded, very cool"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Quite an interesting place for those who want to explore light art or simply want to find a place to chill. This is also a suitable place to take beautiful photos to post on social networks.
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"""There's a place like this in Hanoi too!?"" I visited with great anticipation. It's pretty, but
it's smaller in scale compared to Tokyo's TeamLab Borderless.
If you've ever visited an exhibition hall like this, you probably don't need to come here."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"The exhibition is very beautiful, many beautiful angles to take pictures. The best thing is that you can take pictures freely without using cameras. The price on weekends is a bit expensive."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,What a fun experience for the kids! The price is a bit high but worth it. Definitely a destination for kids in the summer
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Location on the 5th floor of Trang Tien Plaza. The rooms are small and not very impressive. A lot of mirror effects are used for decoration. I went to the Waterfall room but couldn't see any waterfall. The ceiling is quite low so the pictures weren't very nice. I was most interested in the activity of painting scanned pictures, the rest was just a quick glance. The ticket price is not cheap either. I only went once to see it, not impressed."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,There are many Feng Shui products that everyone can get there.
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Very nice! Adults and children both love it.
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Mirrors are used to create a more spacious and multi-dimensional feeling, but in reality, the space is a bit smaller than imagined. When I bought the ticket at the counter, the staff stamped it on my hand, and I didn't like it very much."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"For me, each room is quite small, the mirror effect makes the space feel more multi-dimensional. But it's still worth trying."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Boringest museum we've ever been to. Very little interactive. It doesn't feel like a museum of modern art, but more like entering a low-budget cinema. Based on the ticket price, we had slightly higher expectations."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"4-11 years old but calculated by year of birth
NEVER SEEN ANYWHERE SPECIFIED BY YEAR OF BIRTH NOT DATE OF BIRTH
Too unreasonable
Hope to listen and correct"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Tickets are quite expensive, 180k (holiday promotion included)"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Very interesting visual experience. Great for family activities or dating.
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"The exhibition consists of 5 main rooms and 1 art play area. Visiting all 4 rooms and playing takes about 1h30-2h. Mainly using projector technology, which is quite interesting and new. The ticket price is 200k for adults and 150k for children, quite high."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"The design space is eye-catching, people should stay in each room for a while to feel all the slides shown. The only downside is that the space is small, there are a few rooms to visit."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Personally, if I compare the Van Gogh Monet exhibition (Giga mall) to Tennis - then this I-Museum is like Pickeball :)))
The area is a bit small compared to the ticket price.
(If I have time for the exhibition at Giga mall, I can wander around for half a day before getting bored. As for I-Museum, there is probably not much to experience for more than 2 hours)
More suitable for children to experience.
I hope Hanoi will soon open more exhibitions like this but invest in a larger scale for everyone to experience."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"This is the best date/family trip course in Hanoi💖! ㅎㅎ I never knew there was spatial media art, something I'd only seen in Korea, in Hanoi..! It's so cool and has so many things to see, you'll definitely get 100 photos of your life~~! The ocean-themed media art is especially photogenic, and the refreshing sound of the ocean really makes you feel like you're at the beach🏖️⛱️🏝️🛶

I saw a lot of kids there, and they loved it ㅎㅎ It's also located in the heart of Hoan Kiem Lake, making it a great place to visit after a day of sightseeing! The staff are also super friendly, and I highly recommend it!!🙏🏻👍🏻❣️

Don't worry about where to go for a date/trip in Hanoi, just visit!!

The best place to visit in Hanoi💖! That's right, that's right. Chụp được 100 tấm ảnh sống ảo luôn~~!

Cũng thấy nhiều trẻ em đến chơi và trông chúng rất thích thú! Địa điểm nằm ngay trung tâm hồ Hoàn Kiếm, rất tiện để đi dạo quanh hồ rồi ghé qua đây. Nhan viên thì cực kỳ thân thiện và dịch vụ rất tuyệt vời. Let's go!🙏🏻👍🏻❣️

I don't know what to expect!!"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"the photos and videos are quite nice but seeing it in person is disappointing
the rooms are small, some rooms look spacious because of the many mirrors, the most beautiful room is probably van gogh but there really isn't much to admire 🙁
it wasn't until the last room that I saw... because the hanging lamps were so obvious and not aesthetic at all
I walked around for 30 minutes and didn't leave a single impression"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Inside the department store, the ticket price is not fixed. There are several exhibition rooms, small but worth visiting if you have time. It's not bad."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"a space that combines light, sound, color and movement quite well.
When it's quiet, it's great, you can sit on the floor and watch the sparkling lights in the bamboo forest, or be absorbed in Vincent van Gogh's ""Starry Night""...
There are 5 galleries, but the 2 rooms ""Phu Quoc Sea"" and ""Vietnam Sky"" are ugly 🥲 The Art Room is the best! The last room has some interactive activities for children.

The weekend ticket price is a bit high, it takes about 15 minutes to go quickly 😂 but it's very suitable for taking virtual photos 😄"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"If you're looking for couples or parents with children who have nothing better to do in Hanoi on a rainy day like today, this is the place to go. It's not a large area, but there are plenty of photo spots, and you can take photos by rotating through different screens for about 10 minutes per section. It's a great activity for kids, from coloring the final picture to displaying it on the screen."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"The museum is located on the 5th floor of Trang Tien Plaza. The exhibition space is not very large, the time I went there were only 6 themed rooms. The ticket price for adults is 180,000 VND/person (everyone should buy tickets directly at the counter, booking on travel apps will be more expensive, especially foreigners will be charged a higher price).

Plus points:
- Creative art space, displaying new 3D images, vivid sound. My favorite is the ocean-themed room, showing a day at sea from dawn to late at night. Sit still for a bit, listen to the sound of waves, dolphins, seagulls... suitable for relaxing, releasing emotions.
- There are some activities such as coloring, taking pictures, transforming into 5 elements... suitable for both children and adults.

Minus points:
- The space is still small, not diverse
- Adults should keep an eye on children, especially in rooms with many mirrors, which can easily cause injury.
- The Van Gogh gallery is impressive with Starry Night, the other paintings are quite confusing.

- I think this ticket price is not expensive, but not cheap either. Personally, I think this experience is worth the money, but I hope the museum should expand the exhibition themes."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Okay, I went during the 20% sale because of Tet, it's nice but if you park your car in the basement, be careful because the price is quite expensive."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Going on a holiday was super crowded and the children were noisy and chaotic so it wasn't very fun. Ticket prices will increase on holidays. Because it was my friend's birthday and I had already calculated the schedule in advance, I couldn't change it and I didn't notice that it coincided with my ancestor's death anniversary, so it was a bit crowded and not fun 😭
But overall the museum is very beautiful, if seen in a quieter space it would be great"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"The museum is located in Trang Tien Plaza, 5th floor, prime location. Entrance tickets are quite expensive compared to what you can enjoy. Be patient and walk slowly through each room to feel it more clearly."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"It's not that big, but it was nice because there weren't many people. I went on a Monday afternoon and there were about five people, including me, but we were all in different spaces, so it was nice to just enjoy ourselves quietly."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Beautiful space to check in
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Expensive compared to what you get, there are only about 5-6 rooms, of which about 2 rooms (beach, forest) are ""virtual living"" rooms."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"My baby is 3.5 years old. According to the regulations, 4-11 years old are considered children. 0-3T are free. When I asked, the Care department answered as below!
So it should be clearly stated that 0- under 3 years old are free. 3-11 years old are considered children's tickets?!!
The staff and care department are terrible. The worst experience in Hanoi was coming to this I Museum!!!"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Should go, teenagers and children love it. Remember to bring your student card or install VNid to get discount."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"In my opinion, 180k for the experience of taking pictures in 4 LED rooms is not worth it."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"To do something! Very small and sparse. Literally, Hanoi is my favorite! A chaotic city, with lots of traffic and stress. Anywhere in Vietnam is better."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,A good place to take pictures if you know how to take pictures 😅
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,It says closing time is 9:30 pm but when I arrived at 8:30 pm they said the shift was closed and no guests were accepted.
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,I really like it hehe. Good music but a bit small. I like the lazy chair the most. Fun to play.
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,New experience but still expensive because there are 5 quite small spaces
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Expensive, small room, not nice. Go once to know."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"The place is very ordinary.
Nice for photography.
Won't take more than half an hour.
Nice to visit if you're free or don't have a schedule because it's in the center."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Beautiful
The photos are quite beautiful, each room has a different style"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Good experience, very nice"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Small, uninviting space"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Expensive compared to the quality. There are only 5 rooms in there and I don't know what to do in there. It's not very nice to take pictures. At the end, there is a free workshop and painting. It's bland and not beautiful or fake."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,You can visit with children. The museum is not big. You can see everything in 30 minutes.
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Not knowing whether it's beautiful or not, the attitude of the staff made me not want to buy an entrance ticket. In general, the attitude is boring, not interested in visiting anymore. I hope the owner retrains the staff."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Cheap and worth the price
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Suitable for young people or children. Moderate experience. If it was wider it would be great!
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"Not badly done, but unfortunately much too short. We finished in 45 minutes."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"If you are a foreigner living here, the price is the same as for Koreans.
Just like you get a discount if you have a registration card at the golf course^^

The layout seems good.
Vietnam Garden, waterfall, sea, gallery?, Vietnam Sky
And Vietnam Forest, virtual photo shoot, dancing with sensors

I don't know why the review says there are only five.
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

I went to a place called Songrap in Houyeh,
but there is a price difference between Houyeh people and people from other regions.

It's cheaper if you go on a weekday~"
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,There are many rooms to visit and it is worth the money.
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"The exhibition is small, with little space to experience compared to the price. However, the most annoying thing about the exhibition is that there are different prices between Vietnamese and foreigners. The cost difference between the two prices is not too large but causes discomfort and a feeling of discrimination. Many foreigners are angry with these two prices, whether they are tourists or foreigners living in Vietnam. The difference of 50k/guest does not make the investor richer but it creates a very bad impression."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"In Hanoi, where cultural life is difficult, this is a great place to enjoy the view. It's a great place to take photos, and if you have your residence permit, you'll get a discount, so it's a good idea to bring a photo of your residence permit."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,"I went on a Sunday and it cost 180,000 VND. I recommend going in the morning as there are fewer people. When there are more people it becomes difficult to take photos. I think it's worth going at least once."
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,Too epic
ChIJAcpzbwCrNTERSsISiGsRwDQ,A place worth visiting. The art gallery is impressive. The interactive coloring room is also fun.
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Beautiful beach beautiful people and peaceful
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"When I visited, the rain kept coming and going, so I couldn't fully enjoy the beach.
There were many cafes and restaurants facing the beach, and there were parasols and decks set up along the sea.
I went down to the beach briefly, but the deck manager waved me and yelled at me, so I couldn't go any further.
The intermittent rain was the reason I quickly left Anbang Beach."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"It's about a 40-minute bike ride from Hoi An city. Bicycle parking costs 10,000 yen.
Umbrellas on the beach are free if you buy a drink. You can also enjoy parasailing.
The nearby porridge shop and Purple Lantern Restaurant are also recommended."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Considering everything, Hoi An, Vietnam is actually quite affordable.

A few years ago, I visited the famous An Bang Beach in Hoi An Ancient Town and chose to sit at the SHORE CLUB beachfront restaurant. We sat there from 10:30 AM to 2:30 PM. We ordered two drinks for breakfast, and a pizza and a special chicken wing for lunch. This allowed us to easily go to the beach to play in the water and take photos without having to carry our belongings.

Delicious food, beautiful scenery, and friendly, polite service—all for about 1000 NTD! It was definitely worth it.

The SHORE CLUB beachfront restaurant has a row of seats right by the beach. If you arrive early like us, you can get a seat. Just a short walk away, you can wade in the sand and play in the water—it's fantastic!"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Good
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"It was good, clean beach and lots of shacks around."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Great beach, unfortunately there was bad weather and a storm when we visited."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Yesterday I had a really bad experience at An Bang beach because of the chair and umbrella rental service here. When soliciting customers, the chair rental lady said 50,000 VND/chair if you don't drink anything. Everyone settled down and she gave me the Menu and said that the free chair is only for drinks from 120,000 VND or more to avoid paying 50,000 VND for the chair. Meanwhile, for a can of Cola/Fanta/... they charged 50,000 VND. Cocktails are 120,000 VND, more expensive than at the airport or a 5-star hotel. Meanwhile, the restaurant next door listed the price at 20,000 VND for a can of Cola. After ordering the drinks, I sat down and waited for a long time before someone delivered the drinks to me 😅. It's sad for Hoi An that until now they still tolerate such opportunistic business practices. I went with a group of German friends so I didn’t want to argue too much over a few hundred thousand and ruin everyone’s fun, because it’s true that converted to Euros it’s not worth much but I feel sad for tourism in our country. The streets are full of trash. Food safety is still a matter of luck, …"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"It was a big wave day so we couldn't swim, but the sea here was clean and beautiful. Suong restaurant has fresh seafood, reasonable prices, fast and friendly service."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,It is not recommended during the rainy season. The coastline itself disappears.
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,It's worth visiting once in Da Nang.
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,The beach is quite beautiful
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Only visited the bar/restaurant on the left with the live fish, crayfish, molluscs, in tanks.
Service good. Prices reasonable.
Purchase of a cocktail (~130 vdn) gives you a free lounge under an umbrella on the beach.
Lovely view back to Lady Buddha. Beach suits families or, like us, people who sit back with a Larue/salt coffee/etc and just relax. Easy swimming for Europeans who don't like too big waves."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"On your way to Hoi An, stop by for a mango smoothie or a cup of coconut coffee. This beach has a completely different atmosphere from My Khe Beach. Personally, I think An Bang Beach is a great place to enjoy the Southeast Asian vibe and the quiet atmosphere of Da Nang. The basket boats scattered throughout add to the ambiance."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Sitting, lying down, relaxing on the beach is very comfortable. The waves and wind were great the day I went. It was sunny and fun to swim. However, if the waves and wind are very strong, the officers will not allow swimming for safety reasons."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Very pleasant beach, water at the perfect temperature.
Not too crowded this season, but there's a fair amount of dirt. Even in the beach area, it contributes to it.
They could have the decency to clean up their mess."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,A typhoon came and the waves were huge. I saw the waves were so strong that I couldn't even see them.
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,A better beach than I expected. Great for water play.
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"The beach is beautiful. The weather this season is a bit unpredictable, so if you go out for a bit, it will rain."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Awesome beach even went paragliding
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"The biggest Whirlpool ever, a wild Beast & and tasty Food"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,This place is so beautiful and quiet for newlyweds.
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"As much as I was told, An bang beach was the nearest beach from Hoi Ann but it was a very beautiful beach!! I went in the morning. We felt very refreshed and loved chilliing here!! Must go!"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,I like foreigners
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"You are not allowed to swim, even by the smallest waves. Lifeguards are lazy, trying to keep the beaches clear to avoid paying attention. I personally wouldn’t recommend to go there!!!"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Awesome beach and sun chairs there if you need them. We started without them then got hungry so used them free for cheap meal
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"The beach is beautiful, clean, and has fine sand. There are many international tourists here.

The sand at the shops above the stairs is full of rubbish. I hope the government and the people will cooperate to solve this problem and improve the beauty of the area."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"The best mussel porridge I've ever had, it's cheap and has lots of mussels."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,The beach is ordinary... A fishing beach selling lots of seafood... but I visited in the morning
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Nice clean beach with seafood restaurant around.
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Best quiet place ever
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"The ocean view is amazing. Even the drinks are pictures... good, good, good..."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Beautiful beach, beautiful people and excellent food"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,It's a quiet beach with a local feel.
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Nice beach, pack your suncream if you burn easily haha"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Great for sea views near Hoi An
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"We went there at 10 AM and played until 2 PM, when it was the hottest. There were more foreigners than Koreans, and it was quieter and more secluded than Mikke Beach. There were a lot of cafes and restaurants with great views and a great atmosphere lining the beach, so we could order food and relax. Usually, when you order food at a restaurant near Anbang Beach, you can use everything from parasols to showers for free."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"A must-see. You can easily go by bike. In fact, I recommend it because the scenery is spectacular and you can stop off at the beach.
For three euros, you can have a sun lounger for the whole day. I was even able to buy a bikini for three euros and take advantage of the swim. Food options are everywhere, especially seafood.
For the same price, you can eat on the sun loungers on the beach."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Beautiful beach
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"The waves at Anbang Beach were high and the wind was strong, but the atmosphere of the restaurants nearby was good and there were many restaurants worth visiting around Anbang Beach."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Very beautiful, white beach. Sunbeds cost about 100,000 VND. Very safe. Not very busy. Perfect 👌"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Great seafood! Also excellent coffee!
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Great clean beach
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"it was nice, we had lovely weather the day we went (despite rainy season) plus it’s handy that they have a bar and some showers to wash off your feet or shorts etc. Only slight issue is that there’s quite a few people going around selling which is fairly normal here but just a little annoying getting offered the same bracelet 5 times 😂. Overall had a lovely time and people are generally pretty friendly. Would say it’s more a tourist spot than a hangout for the locals."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"A nice beach with good sand and sea. There are plenty of restaurants along the beach and lots of people who will constantly ask you to go to their restaurant.

On the road towards the beach there are a few bars which are a little walk always from the beach.

A free beach not yet owned by the big companies."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Excellent! Clear sea with fine sand and lots of pretty snails
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Great beach and water sports bits, awesome bars and restaurants on the shore front!"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"The water is shallow and the waves are calm, so it would be nice to play when the weather is nice."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"An Bang Beach in Hoi An is a beautiful and relaxing spot with soft sand and clear water. It’s a great place to swim, walk, or just unwind by the sea. There are plenty of beachside cafes and restaurants where you can grab a drink or meal while enjoying the view. It can get a bit crowded later in the day, but the atmosphere is laid-back and friendly. A perfect place to spend a sunny afternoon in Hoi An."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Won’t stay anywhere else this was a perfect location on the beach food menus was a welcome change with a few home comforts on there.. 🙈 don’t judge… could recommend the staff Enough we arrived at 6.00am early and Emily got out of bead and rushed to looked after us and did not stop the whole stay. Will sort you with anything you need at all makes staying a dream…
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Awesome beach you can rent surfboard Bodyboard launch chairs close to restaurant and shops
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Water was clear! And a lot of restaurants offering beds
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,A place with beautiful beaches and many cafes
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"I really like the feeling of standing in front of the sea here. The sea is clear blue, the sand is white and smooth, the waves are gentle and very pleasant. The cool sea breeze makes me feel comfortable and relaxed. The space is quiet, not too crowded so it feels very peaceful. Walking along the sandy beach, watching the sea and breathing the fresh air is really pleasant."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,A great place to surf
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Wide, expansive golden sands meet calm waters (not the clearest, but overall fine)—perfect for relaxing strolls. Super pleasant vibe with tons of beachfront restaurants offering fresh eats right on the sand. Rented a surfboard easily and had a blast catching waves. Highly recommend!"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"The beach is a bit “mid” because there is no public area along it. You need to go through an alley way between shops to get to the sand. 10 metres of open public space, like a promenade or boardwalk would vitalise the area. A great example in Vietnam are the beaches of DaNang like Mykhe beach. Even though there is intense development the space along the foreshore makes it very pleasant."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Clean, beautiful stretch of beach. Warm water, soft sand, and calm waves perfect for the whole family. Plenty of good restaurants lined along the beach, if you order food from them then you dont have to pay the lounger and umbrella.

We are lucky that we are staying just a good 5 minutes walk away from the beach. During our stay, we get to do our early morning walk and swim in the morning."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Wonderful beach. We visited it during our expeditions in Vietnam. Enjoy! 👍
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Lovely beach
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Perfect beach. Amazing food for next to nothing. Like Thailand a decade ago
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,I imagine it to beautiful and full of people during the day. Seems like a lovely place even at 6pm (already dark so I couldn't see much) but could see friends/families on beach bbqing!
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,It's a very calm beach. And the water only comes up to about 5ft 6inches even 100mtrs into the water. Nice restaurants nearby and some sea side activities. There's a small castle like structure with graffiti on it too!
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Warm & clear waters with clean sands. Loved my time here!
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Cute beach even in stormy weather, at the end of the beach on the south side there is an abandoned building"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Just a beach
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Big waves, cool wind, very comfortable walk"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"We played in the water for over 2 hours! I rested for an hour and ate something delicious. Haha. I applied sunscreen, but it still got sunburned. The water was clean and safe to go deep, and the waves were just right.👍🏻"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"I came here because I heard there were lots of shops and seafood restaurants along the beach, but Hoi An has far more, so I didn't need to take a taxi to get there. However, it's worth a visit to see the open ocean."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Vietnam may be beautiful and nice, but compared to the beaches in South Korea, they are nothing more than a drop in the ocean."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Motorcycle parking lot attendants are not friendly to foreigners.
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Is the beach beautiful c¹llllll
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"A great place for a day at the beach, with a wide selection of beach bars and restaurants. Prices are a bit higher on average, and it's touristy, but it's a beautiful and clean beach."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"into the Rain season, but the date was fine."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Best place that feels relax, neat and clean."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Da Nang beach is clean, clear water, fine sand. Swimming in the early morning is extremely pleasant, truly a destination worth experiencing! 🌊"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"One of the most beautiful beaches in Vietnam! Da Nang beach is wide, airy, has a separate bathing area for tourists, and has lifeguards on duty for safety. Nearby are many hotels, beachside cafes and great places to take photos. Anyone who comes to Da Nang should definitely visit My Khe beach at least once."

ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,ok
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,Clean and beautiful
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"A blue beach in the middle of the city. This beach is incredibly beautiful.

If you want to see the best spots, it's best to visit in June or July. December is when the waves are usually big, making the sea water murky.

In the mornings, it's bustling with locals exercising. Vietnamese people are very into sports."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"It's truly wonderful, one of the most beautiful beaches in Vietnam as well as in the world, clean, smooth sand, moderate waves, flat beach, blue water, great view, clean beach, well maintained"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,Beautiful beach!!!
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"About a five-minute walk from my hotel, I visited the famous My Khe Beach. The sand was so fine and soft that many people walked barefoot. The sea breeze was refreshing, and the sound of the waves was soothing.

Early in the morning, it was bustling with people strolling, swimming, and surfing, but the atmosphere was lively and pleasant. It was the perfect place to start my day in Da Nang.

Just a five-minute walk from my hotel, I visited the famous My Khe Beach. The sand is incredibly fine and soft, so many people were walking barefoot along the shore. The sea breeze was cool and refreshing, and the sound of the waves was soothing.

Even early in the morning, the beach was full of energy—people jogging, swimming, and surfing. Despite the crowds, the atmosphere felt relaxed and vibrant at the same time. It's truly one of the best spots to start your morning in Da Nang."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"My Khe Beach at 10:30 on October 22, 2025, before storm No. 12 combined with increased cold air, the provinces from Quang Tri to Da Nang city in the afternoon had winds gradually increasing to level 6, sometimes level 7, gusting to level 8-9."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,Good beach..clean
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,The beach scenery was very pretty.
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,Very beautiful and peaceful
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,The beach is clean and beautiful. The people are also very nice.
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Gorgeous beach
The lifeguard puts up red flags, go spend a nice day at the beach, and can’t swim.
If you have a boogie or a surf board you can, everyone else that enters the water the lifeguard is blowing his whistle.   Go further up , same beach   The lifeguard there doesn’t close off the water"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Clean and beautiful sea, calm beach at night, worth the experience"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"The golden moon shines
The mirror-like sea
The silver waves crash on the shore
Whose boat is casting its net?"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,Such a beautiful place it was! You can also do some water sports like parasailing here. The place was crowded but then too the beach and the streets were so clean. In the evening the place was really very happening.
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"12 years ago and now the same, Danang people are very friendly, beautiful beach"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Beautiful sea, clear water"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,AWesome
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"I went to My Khe Beach - Da Nang in the summer and was really impressed with the fine white sand, clear blue water, and moderate waves. The coastal area is very clean, with a regular cleaning team and a professionally organized public bathing area. 

The sunrise in the morning is extremely beautiful, many people bathe early or exercise on the beach, the air is fresh and pleasant. 

However, during peak season, there are quite a lot of visitors, especially in the evening, so it is a bit noisy and difficult to find a parking space. 

In return, near the beach there are many cafes, delicious seafood restaurants, reasonable prices, friendly service. 

Overall, Da Nang beach deserves to be one of the most beautiful and worth-experiencing beaches in Vietnam. 🌊"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,I like walking along the beach
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,This is the main Beach area. Can get a little crowded but great place to swim and surf.
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,My Khe dep vcl😍😍
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,MUKSH
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,Pleasant beach with palms and lots of places around the boulevard to sit down have a drink or grab a bite. Even got at a good time to see (and help!) the fishermen pull out the fishing nets
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Every morning and evening, it's bustling with locals exercising, so we can join in too.

I tried joining in, and it was so tiring I couldn't finish. 😂

Vietnamese people really love exercise, and the government even provides facilities. 👍🏻

If you don't want to exercise, just sitting around is really nice here. 🤣🤣"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,Fuck it!
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Very nice
My home town
Love it"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"It's a lovely, quiet beach.
It was wonderful to spend time relaxing and gazing at the ocean."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"The morning air is very fresh, very suitable for watching the sunrise, exercising, swimming, visiting and buying seafood, pulling nets in the morning. Very wonderful."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Top clean and beautiful beaches in Vietnam. Strolling along the beach to enjoy the cool breeze, listening to the murmuring waves or immersing yourself in the cool blue sea water is a wonderful experience not only for locals but also for tourists from all over."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,The best beach in the world
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"10/6 Full Moon and Poodle-Shaped Clouds
A Wide, Beautiful Sea"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,The most beautiful beaches I have ever been to
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"I just want to say, this is all so beautiful! A must-do in Da Nang. For those working long hours and needing a quiet and relaxing place to refresh their souls, Da Nang Beach 🏖️ is definitely the perfect choice. There are plenty of drinks for sale 🥤 and lounge chairs for those looking out at the ocean. It's truly relaxing, and just staring at the ocean and letting your mind wander is a kind of spiritual healing. Everyone here is very disciplined, and the beach is incredibly clean. I won't be able to comment on this personally in the future, but for now, it's all wonderful to me. I sincerely hope you'll come and take a look 👀"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,beautiful beach
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,I like
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"I took a Grab from my accommodation in Da Nang City to My Khe Beach. The best destination is ""the beach across from the M Hotel."" A surfing school operates on the beach across from the M Hotel, and a long rope marks the safety zone, making swimming only permitted here. Lifeguards are also on duty, which is why so many people flock here. Herbal Pizza is nearby, so you can enjoy pizza or steak with beer while watching the sunset. It's also fascinating to see vacationers from all over the world enjoying themselves in various ways. The beach stretches for 33 kilometers, which is impressive. I happened to spot a gorgeous girl practicing her dance moves on the beach (video available). I wish her a wonderful future."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"I went there in the early evening of October. Miraculously, it was sunny and cool. It was a fantastical space, lined with bars and massage parlors and many people relaxing on the sand. If it's sunny, it's a place worth strolling in the evening or at night."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Danang is home to the stunning My Khe Beach, considered one of the most natural beaches. My Khe is a popular destination among tourists to relax, have fun, and enjoy the seabreeze. Locals flocks to the area as well for their daily exercises and outdoor activities.

The beach is known for its long stretch of fine white sands and the picturesque boardwalk. The gentle waves is great for swimming and relaxing. You can chill at a lounger chair while sipping on your favorite drinks."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"I went there every morning during my four-day stay in Da Nang.
This beach is a perfect place to experience the local atmosphere.
It's bustling from 4 a.m.: people exercising, fishing, seniors swimming with plastic bottles in their hands, locals enjoying sand baths and sunbathing, YouTubers filming, couples... The sea is also less hot in the early morning, and the sea of ​​Da Nang locals and foreigners mix, creating their own unique waves. I really love this beach, where the waves, sunrises, and the daily lives and travels of the people all intermingle."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"It was a light rain, but the beach was beautiful. If I come here again, I'd like to stay at a hotel along the beach."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"🍃Environment:
The coastline is truly long.
We came here to catch the sunrise, but it was cloudy after the rain that morning, so we couldn't see it. The few people watching were probably tourists.
5. When it was busy, some people were already showering 🚿 and doing morning exercises. It felt like most of the place was local.
Although it's considered one of the ""six best beaches in the world,"" aside from the soft sand perfect for lounging on a lounge chair, I haven't yet discovered its beauty. I hope to visit again someday."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"one of Da Nang’s most beautiful spots — clean sand, clear water, and a relaxing vibe. Perfect for swimming, walking, or watching the sunset. 🌅🌴"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"At first glance, I thought I was Korean... Looking at the palm trees, I guess I'm overseas...
The palm trees made for a nice walk... Honestly, I didn't want to go into the ocean. There are public restrooms, but during the day, you see things like cockroaches, but at night, they're gone."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,great
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"It was a very beautiful sandy beach and I was glad that it was close to the hotel where I was staying. 
I didn't go in, but I'd like to go next time."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"My Khe Beach is beautiful and very clean, with soft white sand and clear blue water. It’s a great place to relax, walk along the shore, or watch the sunrise. The beach is quite long and not too crowded, even during the day. There are also plenty of cafés and local food stalls nearby. Overall, it’s one of the nicest beaches I’ve visited in Vietnam! 🌊☀️"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Stayed in Da Nang 1 month, came to this beach 6 times a week, soo nice and relaxing."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Really beautiful and peaceful beach. It’s clean, quiet, and not crowded even in the morning. The sand is soft and the water is clear, with barely any trash around which is nice to see.

I went for a walk here around sunrise and it was super calming — just the sound of waves and a few locals jogging or swimming. Definitely one of the nicer beaches I’ve been to in Vietnam. Perfect spot to relax and unwind."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"A beautiful beach, even in the evening with the lighting, very nice, very clean and not extremely crowded with tourists, as is the case in European countries."

ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"An ordinary sea like all seas, its color is gray. I came in the winter season!! There are no services or chairs, and I did not feel that it was a tourist sea and that they did not care about tourists. As I said, I came in the winter season, so it might be closed or something, I do not know."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Mesmerizing and super clean beach with fine sand, superb view of the surrounding buildings and coastline. No wonder this is dubbed as the Asia equivalent of Miami."

Developed tourism services, many delicious seafood restaurants, fresh air, is a destination not to be missed when coming to Da Nang."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"The waves were strong, so I had fun swimming. It's great for swimming, but you can also relax on a sunbed and drink Tiger Beer. The water quality is about the same as the sea off Daecheon."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,One of the most beautiful beaches in Vietnam! Lots of tourists come here to sunbathe! Drinks are reasonably priced! There are many nice hotels and delicious restaurants along the road along the beach!
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"A beautiful, long beach with fine golden sand and generally calm waters. When I was there, the sea temperature was around 29 degrees...

ChIJb2RuNUcNQjERLnrsPFVlolw,"Fun experience drifting along the river in our little coconut boat.We had a brief spell of fishing with little bamboo rods while our driver made us each a ring made out of bamboo,very clever.Our driver also did a brilliant Michael Jackson impression,he was quite a character.Enjoyable morning.Thank you"
ChIJb2RuNUcNQjERLnrsPFVlolw,This tour was amaziing.A must thing to do when visiting Hoi An .Nhat was very helpful and funny.Fantastic value for money
ChIJb2RuNUcNQjERLnrsPFVlolw,"Disappointing experience as we had to change guide after 5 mins because the only word he new in English was Bamboo.
Sadly didn’t get the chance to learn how to paddle the boat..
no watching basket boat spinning
No watching casting the fishing net
Feels a bit like of a tourist trap to be honest !"

ChIJb2RuNUcNQjERLnrsPFVlolw,We were all a bit disappointed with the experience. The path to the boat is not laid out well. The ride was very short and not exciting. The guides were very pushy and insistent on us giving them tips even though we already paid them 600k for 2 boats for a ride we did not enjoy. We regretted not going to the coconut village instead.
ChIJb2RuNUcNQjERLnrsPFVlolw,Nhut was awesome during the ballad. Thank you so much for the good memory
ChIJb2RuNUcNQjERLnrsPFVlolw,"Happy people, unforgettable experience"
ChIJb2RuNUcNQjERLnrsPFVlolw,"Very friendly people, attentive to detail (you'll be amazed if you go), and a relaxing atmosphere. 100% recommended, come!"
ChIJb2RuNUcNQjERLnrsPFVlolw,"Fun experience, but shorter than advertised. We were told the bamboo boat ride would be an hour, but it lasted barely 30 minutes, with about 10 minutes of actual rowing, mainly staged for photo ops by the professional photographers who want you to buy the prints.

Disappointing if you’re expecting to really explore the coconut forest. That said, our guide Nhut was fantastic, fun, knowledgeable, and passionate about Hoi An. He made the experience memorable.

Just know what you’re getting: a quick, entertaining ride, not an in-depth river tour."
ChIJb2RuNUcNQjERLnrsPFVlolw,"Recommended by our guide Nahn, it was a fun experience. It's a shame about the infernal heat. Sunscreen is essential. The vegetation of the salt lagoon is home to millions of crabs and spiders. Mosquitoes only appear in the evening. The paddlers are very skilled and friendly.

ChIJb2RuNUcNQjERLnrsPFVlolw,"Very nice trip. Nhut was a great guide who made sure to talk a lot about ever aspect of the trip.
We got to see them take scrimos out of the nets and crap fishing (we didnt catch any tho).
We got a few photos taken both on our own phones and a stall that sells them.

Overall a great experience.

Be aware of the following that pulled my review down:
It is very hard to say no to the pictures as you can get the feeling that you have to sya no to the driver. I'm sure he is used to it, but if you are an introvert it can be hard.
Also they expect to get a review while they are looking, which in my opinion will always drag down the stars."
ChIJb2RuNUcNQjERLnrsPFVlolw,"A great trip, and really nice boat drivers and Nhut was really helpful!  Worth doing when in Hoi An!"

ChIJb2RuNUcNQjERLnrsPFVlolw,"We had a lovely trip on the bamboo basket boat for about 45 minutes. After that we did some cycling around the area. Both our guides (we had a different one on the boat) were very enthousiastic, happy, funny and lovely with our kids. It was a nice trip in Hoi An."
ChIJb2RuNUcNQjERLnrsPFVlolw,"The bamboo basket boat ride is very nice, not too crowded and noisy, the price is very reasonable."

ChIJb2RuNUcNQjERLnrsPFVlolw,"We had an amazing boat ride! We arrived early at 8:30 AM and had the river all to ourselves – it was so peaceful ☺️. Nhat was smiling the whole time, created a great atmosphere, and took really good care of us. We received hats for photos, he created a ring for us, so nice. 😍

With a bit of a heavy heart, I’m giving 4 stars instead of 5. The tour is already a bit more expensive than others, and Nhat took quite a large tip to our standards simply because I didn’t have change. He kept the difference without asking or offering to give change back, which I found a bit off-putting. I would have preferred to give a tip by my own choice, not like that. Sorry, Nhat."

ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Beautiful but deserted
Art is not for the masses"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"As a wet afternoon activity this is worth a visit, if only to enjoy the bureaocracy of buying a ticket and then having the security guard do the swipe check in for you.  As ever, the staff are friendly and helpful. There is a wide variety of paintings as well as sculptures here, arranged over 3 stories connected by stairs. Some sections are dedicated to particular Vietnamese artists or collectors. Personally I was most impressed by some of the sculptures, such as ""the eyes"". It's a matter for your taste. One criticism is that the lighting of some of the paintings is quite poor, creating shadows that affect the aspect of the art."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,Beautiful museum with 3 floors
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,Super cheap to see beautiful art!
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"This is a great thing to do on a rainy day.  The exhibition is over three levels with more traditional examples at the top.  A really diverse collection and we are glad we came.  There was a small fee to enter $20000, and we were almost the only people there."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Admission: 50,000 won
View historical and cultural sites
No air conditioning? It's hot
Viewing time: approximately 1 hour"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Delicious food, great environment, and attentive service"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Since our plans to visit Hoi An were derailed by the approaching typhoon, we decided to stick with indoor activities and visited the Danang Art Museum which we found surprisingly good.

It is clear the Vietnamese artists have absorbed influences from other countries including France, Japan, Indonesia etc. and have applied those forms as well as their own to Vietnamese contexts.

Some of the contemporary works are of a very good quality that I would be happy to display at home."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"I just had a very interesting visit to the Da Nang Fine Arts Museum. Located right in the city center, easy to find even though the city is always bustling with traffic. From the moment I entered, I felt the concentrated cultural space, with works of art imbued with Vietnamese identity. 

This museum is not really big, but enough to impress me with its diversity. Sculptures, oil paintings and even some modern graphic works, all truly reflect the life and people in Vietnam. In particular, I love the way they display the works, not too close or too far, enough to be able to feel every smallest detail. 

An interesting point is the enthusiasm of the museum staff. They are not only attentive but also have good knowledge about the works, helping me understand more about the meaning of each work I see. Perhaps a bit of a pity here is that the English information is limited, so if you don't ask the staff, foreign visitors will have a hard time understanding it themselves. 

I was also particularly impressed with the way the museum exploits natural light, making the works always shine in the most natural way. For me, it was a very good experience and worth a visit. Hopefully next time I come back, I can see more new works."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Great place, very serene. A beautiful collection with temporary exhibitions on the first floor."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,Nice couple of hours spent here.
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,Feel great and full of art
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Very nice little museum, but with interesting pieces! We were lucky enough to be there for the Women’s temporary exhibition. Three levels for an all around vision of DaNang art. Ac present in the exhibition room and toilet in each floor. The inly down part is the lighting that should be thought out better to improve the quality of the place. Only 20k entrance ticket totally worth it"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Beautiful museum with scientific layout, accepts ticket transfers and has free lockers"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,Viewing good works
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"It's clean, the work is good, it's cool, and there are no people."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"I stopped by the Da Nang Museum during my spare time and then used Grab to get there. It's very close to the Da Nang Museum. You can think of it as a small art gallery. I quickly saw everything in about 15 minutes. It was great for taking photos of the Vietnamese art scene. The staff were very friendly. It's about the size of the Insa Art Center in Insa-dong, and you can think of it as a two-story exhibition hall."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Tickets cost 20,000 won at the booth on the roadside.
There are lockers to store your luggage on the right side of the lobby.
There's air conditioning, and each floor has a bathroom. The cozy space is perfect for sightseeing. There are also chairs scattered throughout for resting.
However, please keep the doors closed when entering in groups and refrain from making loud noises, as if you were talking at home."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,Great every detail and space even the flaps leave a very impressive impression.
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"The admission fee was 20,000D for adults and free for elementary school children.
There were pamphlets in Japanese, Korean, and English, so I was able to understand the works a little better.
The content was good, but most of the works did not have cases so you could touch them, so you need to be careful, especially if you have children with you."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,you do very good for society
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,Excellent museum.  Wonderful  exhibition!!
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"The Fine Arts Museum in Da Nang is a wonderful place to explore for anyone who appreciates creativity and culture. The collection is surprisingly rich, with so many art pieces on display — ranging from traditional Vietnamese works to modern and contemporary styles. Walking through the galleries, you can feel the diversity of artistic expression, from detailed sculptures to vibrant paintings and unique local crafts.

The museum is well-organized, making it easy to navigate through different sections. Each room offers something new, and I really enjoyed seeing how Vietnamese culture, history, and daily life are reflected in the artworks. It’s a great balance of heritage and modern imagination.

The staff are polite and helpful, and the space is calm, quiet, and comfortable — perfect for taking your time to enjoy each piece. For such an affordable entry, it truly feels like a cultural treasure that many visitors overlook.

If you’re in Da Nang and want to experience something beyond beaches and food, I highly recommend spending an afternoon here. It’s inspiring, educational, and gives you a deeper appreciation of the city’s artistic soul."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,There are actually many interesting things everyone should visit once.
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,My daughter really likes it
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"A good modern museum, but stuffy at lunchtime"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"A very interesting place, full of beautiful paintings. If you enjoy seeing various art pieces in different techniques that's definitely a place worth visiting."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"This art museum in downtown Da Nang primarily exhibits works by local artists. The first thing that surprised me was the incredibly low admission fee of 20,000 VND (approximately 120 yen). That alone made it worth a visit.

The museum has three floors, each with its own unique exhibits. I enjoyed the wide variety of artworks, including oil paintings, sculptures, and lacquerware. The lacquerware paintings in particular were incredibly delicate and beautiful, completely changing my image of Vietnam. There were also silk paintings on display, allowing you to experience Vietnam's history and culture firsthand. Some of the works featured the Vietnam War, and while they deal with the harsh theme of war, some also exude a warm, human touch.

The exhibition space was reasonably well-attended, without being too crowded, allowing for a relaxed viewing experience. The museum is air-conditioned throughout, making it a perfect place to visit on a hot day. There are many impressive works, but the museum is just the right size to take your time and look around in about an hour to an hour and a half.

The reception staff were friendly, and there were lockers available to store your luggage, so it was nice to be able to browse without having to carry anything. It's also within walking distance of Han Market, so it's a great place to stop by while sightseeing.

By the way, tickets can only be purchased with cash at the entrance. Considering the size of the museum, there was no waiting time and entry was smooth. I didn't feel the need to make a reservation in advance. If you're looking for a quiet, affordable cultural experience in Da Nang, this is a hidden gem that I highly recommend."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"The Fine Arts Museum surprised me with its collection of modern and traditional Vietnamese art. It’s quiet, peaceful, and inspiring. You should take time to explore each gallery carefully. I highly recommend this museum for art enthusiasts—it’s a wonderful way to understand Da Nang’s creative spirit."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"A nice and not crowded museum, can walk and look at the paintings and exponats without a rush. The staff is very helpful. The entrance fee was 20.000. 3 floors with restrooms on each floor."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"There are works that made me stop and look at them in more detail. Entry is only 20,000"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,The lacquer paintings alone are worth the trip
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Entrance ticket for students is only 10,000 VND, quiet area has 3 separate floors about each different story, the paintings are full of art and calm when you set foot here, right in the center of Da Nang city and clean and airy. I really like it."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"I really liked the museum, I recommend it)"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Admission is 20,000 VND. There are three floors and the exhibition starts with relatively young works. There is a collection of Toyokichi Ito. There are many attractive works, mainly Vietnamese landscapes and people, using a variety of art materials. There is no souvenir shop."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,It is medicore art museum nothing really impressive yet worth visiting if uou are interested in Vietnamese local art!
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"The exhibition of paintings by young artists is very beautiful, the upper floors also have many interesting areas. The entrance fee is 20k so everyone should try it. A small suggestion is that the light shining directly on the painting frame is glaring and difficult to see."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Having visited many museums in and outside the country, in terms of scale, the Da Nang Fine Arts Museum is not too large. Normally, when I go to a museum, I will prepare to spend half a day or even a whole day here. But the museums in Da Nang have not, most of them are only about 2-3 hours. 
Speaking specifically about the Da Nang Museum, the day I went was during the exhibition on Hue heritage, many parts were quite interesting and provided useful information, such as sketch collections of artists, Giang A Luoi weaving heritage, Thanh Tien paper flowers, etc. The upper floors also have exhibitions that can be stopped to admire and learn for a long time, because there are QR codes on most of the works so you can scan the code to hear about the author and the work. For me, the lacquer paintings displayed here are quite impressive. In addition, there is also a unique exhibition space for painter Le Ba Dang. 
The downside is that the space is a bit dark, I don't see any management so the protection of the artifacts is probably mainly the self-awareness of the visitors :))) The second downside is the heat and stuffiness. I wanted to stay longer, but in a space that is not bright enough, hot and stuffy, it is very difficult. Most museums have air conditioning, but in Da Nang it seems not. Da Nang Museum has air conditioning in some exhibition rooms, but not in others. Champa Museum has no air conditioning, so fans are on, the day I went was so hot :)))) The fine arts museum doesn't even have fans. Luckily it was just after rain that day so it was cool, otherwise I don't know how long it would last 😂😂😂 I hope the managers pay attention to the experience of visitors. I will think again whether to come a second time or not because I don't think it's really wow."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Amazing art! The staff wasn’t fluent in English, but they provided an English flyer/guide, and the painting descriptions were also available in English."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"The perfect place to gain a different view of Da Nang and Vietnam. See all sorts of art as well as historical items and antiquities. Learn about different villages close to the city, and what their specific craft is, such as gold making, stone carving etc. Two floors of visual delights, offering a unique aspect. There was only one other couple when I visited mid day, its not crowded and very affordable."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,Absolutely beautiful
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Good interesting works that you can really look at. The museum is quite small, but the entrance fee is symbolic. So I think it is a must-see if you like fine art."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Quite small museum, it took us about 30 min to walk through all the halls. Was not impressed but for the rainy day it was ok"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"A very worth-visiting place in Da Nang! Displaying many valuable paintings, especially about a period of Fine Arts in the central and southern regions as well as Vietnam in general."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,Probably my favorite museum in Vietnam. The artwork is so beautiful and extensive from watercolor to sculpture work and my personal favorite lacquer. Was very impressed with the collections. The lighting isn't the best for taking photos of the works but art is better experienced in person anyway so do yourself a favor and stop by.
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,Interesting collection ranging from Vietnamese modern art to ancient art
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"We liked the experience here! Could have been better, but we still liked it. No elevator was a problem for coming with a baby. Some of the paintings are very beautiful. The audio guides are not really helpful ..."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Love the places, especially section of Le Ba Dang and his works"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Such an incredible experience. Please go check this place of cultural heritage, significance, artistry, an amazing place to spend a few hours experiencing the local culture."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,Entrance fee is 20 thousand dong.
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,Very like
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,Pretty
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"The museum could be nice and interesting, but the lighting really hinders the visit...
There are reflections on all the paintings, which aren't equipped with anti-reflective glass. It's a shame, because many of the works are poorly presented..."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"This museum is a must-visit. 20,000 VND (cash payment only) is very affordable and reasonable for the quality.

Don’t be discouraged by Level 1 — the real treasures await on Levels 2 and 3, where you can truly enjoy the art.

It’s quiet, spacious, and fully air-conditioned, creating the perfect environment for peaceful viewing and appreciation. One of its best features is how uncrowded it is, allowing you to take your time with each piece.

I especially love how close you can get to some of the artworks — you can examine the intricate details up close, something rarely possible in most international museums where barriers or red lines keep visitors at a distance.

Come and enjoy this educational and tranquil attraction — a welcome escape from the constant buzz of city traffic."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,The newest and most modern museum in Da Nang. Cool and comfortable.
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"First time visit in 2014, when the museum just inaugurated for a week. Very impressive!"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,Conditional.
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"The museum is as described, but there are few exhibits. The explanations of lacquer, oil painting, etc. are not very clear. There are explanations if you scan the QR code. Buy tickets before entering."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Looking for a quiet and artsy spot in Da Nang? The Da Nang Fine Arts Museum is a great choice. It's located in a beautiful French colonial building and the atmosphere is very peaceful and pleasant.

Here, you can admire over 1,000 artworks, including paintings, sculptures, and lacquer work. It's a great opportunity to learn more about Vietnamese art through pieces inspired by local life and traditions."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"The staff are super friendly. Students get in for free and students only get in for 10k. The exhibition is huge, 3 floors high and there are lots of things to see."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Payment only in cash. The museum itself is small, pleasant and air-conditioned."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Come everyone, beautiful space, cool air conditioning, extremely pleasing to the eye, many paintings have QR codes for you to save photos and read information."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Very good impressive goog excellent exiting, entertaining experience"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Nice collection of art on three floors. I especially liked the drawings of war-time scenes on the ground floor.
Nice and cool inside."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,The museum is airy and cool. The lights highlight the paintings on the walls. There are many paintings of many genres.
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"The show is very well executed.
However, access is complicated."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"A good selection of art objects. Allows you to understand the local culture as opposed to the kitsch of modern amusement parks. When you get tired of beach idleness, you can quietly, calmly and tastefully spend an hour of time. There is a qr in English with the history of the author and paintings."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,interesting
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,I love art so much and I will go explore here I will never forget this place
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,It's quiet and nice~
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"I went to the Cham Museum a few days ago, and today I came to the Danang Art Museum~ Entrance fee 20,000 dong/ It was nice that there was air conditioning. (The Cham Museum has a fan)

It was nice to slowly look around the various works on the 1st to 3rd floors!"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"A peaceful place, with quiet moments of contemplation about war, life and country
Worth experiencing
Ticket price 20k. Free for children"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"An incredibly interesting museum! We didn't expect anything special for such a cheap entrance fee, but this museum amazed us with its exhibition. A huge number of unusual works of art - various paintings, sculptures. I didn't think I would ever be so impressed by modern art. If you are in Da Nang, be sure to visit this museum, you will definitely be delighted."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"With only 20k/ticket, this is an ideal place to relax and learn more about art history. The space is spacious but the lighting is a bit dark. I like the lacquer paintings and sculptures."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"The entrance fee is 20,000 VND. When I went there, there was no one else there and it was a private venue. I was able to enjoy the works of artists with ties to Da Nang while relaxing."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"I think 20,000 for the entrance is quite an adequate price. Inside it is very calm, cool, the atmosphere is exactly like a museum. Very interesting works. I liked everything"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"There is only a little bit of propaganda-style art here, and many pure modern art pieces. There is air conditioning, and the works are displayed on the 2nd and 3rd floors."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"It's a bit far from Da Nang when you're not there. It's cool because there's air conditioning, and it's a very quiet place. When I visited, there were paintings by an artist who is revered in Vietnam for his Vietnam War-related paintings on the first and second floors."

ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,I recommend visiting!
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,Interesting and very fun :D
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"If you have been to foreign museums, the Da Nang Fine Arts Museum is at a very moderate level. However, what a local attraction can bring to me is the effort to express the artistic space. Folk paintings, sculptures of some ethnic groups,... are all expressed in a respectful manner. And perhaps the most precious to me are some works by Mr. Le Ba Dang - an artistic monument of Vietnam."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Admission fee 20,000 won"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,A place worth experiencing. Friendly and enthusiastic staff.
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Small and cozy.
Average.
There is lighting, but it's not much...
Except for a few major works,
It doesn't bring the works to life.
Rather, it's frustrating."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Nothing to see, not much…"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"The museum is open every day of the week, from 8am to 5pm, without time restrictions like the Da Nang Museum. Ticket price is 10k/person, no parking fee. The museum has 3 display areas, especially a separate area displaying works by artist Le Ba Dang, one of the famous painters of Vietnam. 

The space is large, however, to ensure no damage, the works are all framed in glass. The light in the museum is a bit dark, the paintings are framed in glass, so sometimes the light is quite bright when you come to see them up close. This also affects the viewer and the works."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,A rewarding experience
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"The tickets are cheap, there is air conditioning, not many people, and it is very comfortable to visit."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,Very nice space and high quality art. A good window to Vietnamese culture - recommend!
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"The tickets are cheap, the collection covers three floors, it is worth a visit"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Tickets are 2w, and it brings together various works by local artists, which is worth seeing"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"A small museum that exhibits works of some well-known local artists. Very cheap entrance fee of 20,000 VND. Good to drop by if you are interested in art and have about 1.5 hours to spare."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,Good service
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Great museum! I recommend visiting at least once. 3 floors of amazing works, works of silk, wood, varnish and oil. Very interesting exhibits. Entrance fee is only 20k"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Affordable, cool art gallery with restrooms on each floor. Close to Danang Han Market."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,It also offers virtual experience through qr codes scanning for voice narration of the art pieces :) such nice experience
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"The space is suitable for introverts like me. It only costs 20k to enter but I have contributed to supporting the care of orphans and disabled children. Hopefully the museum will be known by more tourists because the day I went, although it was the weekend, it was quite deserted."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,Definitely worth visiting
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,Worth the experience
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"The price is very reasonable. 60,000 VND for 2 adults and 2 children.. Seeing art works in Vietnam.. The red color that you can feel a lot in the paintings seems to be a Vietnamese sensibility. It's worth a visit."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,It was fun and best of all it was cheap.
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"I don't know how to appreciate art, just visit."
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"Quite many impressive artworks in a small space. (You may not feel your legs are heavy.)
So small admission fee of 20K VND.
AC is on.
You can take pictures of the works.
No reason to hesitate if you are interested in art.
Minus one star for the smelly toilet on the 3rd flr. (Can't complain considering the small fee they charge actually)"
ChIJ78thjjYYQjERkiy-c9ebVPE,"The entrance fee is only 20k. The place is amazing. There are 3 floors with a lot of pictures, sculptures, masks, and old historic jewellery."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Beautiful beach beautiful people and peaceful
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"When I visited, the rain kept coming and going, so I couldn't fully enjoy the beach.
There were many cafes and restaurants facing the beach, and there were parasols and decks set up along the sea.
I went down to the beach briefly, but the deck manager waved me and yelled at me, so I couldn't go any further.
The intermittent rain was the reason I quickly left Anbang Beach."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"It's about a 40-minute bike ride from Hoi An city. Bicycle parking costs 10,000 yen.
Umbrellas on the beach are free if you buy a drink. You can also enjoy parasailing.
The nearby porridge shop and Purple Lantern Restaurant are also recommended."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Considering everything, Hoi An, Vietnam is actually quite affordable.

A few years ago, I visited the famous An Bang Beach in Hoi An Ancient Town and chose to sit at the SHORE CLUB beachfront restaurant. We sat there from 10:30 AM to 2:30 PM. We ordered two drinks for breakfast, and a pizza and a special chicken wing for lunch. This allowed us to easily go to the beach to play in the water and take photos without having to carry our belongings.

Delicious food, beautiful scenery, and friendly, polite service—all for about 1000 NTD! It was definitely worth it.

The SHORE CLUB beachfront restaurant has a row of seats right by the beach. If you arrive early like us, you can get a seat. Just a short walk away, you can wade in the sand and play in the water—it's fantastic!"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Good
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"It was good, clean beach and lots of shacks around."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Great beach, unfortunately there was bad weather and a storm when we visited."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Yesterday I had a really bad experience at An Bang beach because of the chair and umbrella rental service here. When soliciting customers, the chair rental lady said 50,000 VND/chair if you don't drink anything. Everyone settled down and she gave me the Menu and said that the free chair is only for drinks from 120,000 VND or more to avoid paying 50,000 VND for the chair. Meanwhile, for a can of Cola/Fanta/... they charged 50,000 VND. Cocktails are 120,000 VND, more expensive than at the airport or a 5-star hotel. Meanwhile, the restaurant next door listed the price at 20,000 VND for a can of Cola. After ordering the drinks, I sat down and waited for a long time before someone delivered the drinks to me 😅. It's sad for Hoi An that until now they still tolerate such opportunistic business practices. I went with a group of German friends so I didn’t want to argue too much over a few hundred thousand and ruin everyone’s fun, because it’s true that converted to Euros it’s not worth much but I feel sad for tourism in our country. The streets are full of trash. Food safety is still a matter of luck, …"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"It was a big wave day so we couldn't swim, but the sea here was clean and beautiful. Suong restaurant has fresh seafood, reasonable prices, fast and friendly service."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,It is not recommended during the rainy season. The coastline itself disappears.
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,It's worth visiting once in Da Nang.
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,The beach is quite beautiful
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Only visited the bar/restaurant on the left with the live fish, crayfish, molluscs, in tanks.
Service good. Prices reasonable.
Purchase of a cocktail (~130 vdn) gives you a free lounge under an umbrella on the beach.
Lovely view back to Lady Buddha. Beach suits families or, like us, people who sit back with a Larue/salt coffee/etc and just relax. Easy swimming for Europeans who don't like too big waves."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"On your way to Hoi An, stop by for a mango smoothie or a cup of coconut coffee. This beach has a completely different atmosphere from My Khe Beach. Personally, I think An Bang Beach is a great place to enjoy the Southeast Asian vibe and the quiet atmosphere of Da Nang. The basket boats scattered throughout add to the ambiance."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Sitting, lying down, relaxing on the beach is very comfortable. The waves and wind were great the day I went. It was sunny and fun to swim. However, if the waves and wind are very strong, the officers will not allow swimming for safety reasons."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Very pleasant beach, water at the perfect temperature.
Not too crowded this season, but there's a fair amount of dirt. Even in the beach area, it contributes to it.
They could have the decency to clean up their mess."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,A typhoon came and the waves were huge. I saw the waves were so strong that I couldn't even see them.
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,A better beach than I expected. Great for water play.
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"The beach is beautiful. The weather this season is a bit unpredictable, so if you go out for a bit, it will rain."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Awesome beach even went paragliding
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"The biggest Whirlpool ever, a wild Beast & and tasty Food"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,This place is so beautiful and quiet for newlyweds.
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"As much as I was told, An bang beach was the nearest beach from Hoi Ann but it was a very beautiful beach!! I went in the morning. We felt very refreshed and loved chilliing here!! Must go!"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,I like foreigners
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"You are not allowed to swim, even by the smallest waves. Lifeguards are lazy, trying to keep the beaches clear to avoid paying attention. I personally wouldn’t recommend to go there!!!"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Awesome beach and sun chairs there if you need them. We started without them then got hungry so used them free for cheap meal
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"The beach is beautiful, clean, and has fine sand. There are many international tourists here.

The sand at the shops above the stairs is full of rubbish. I hope the government and the people will cooperate to solve this problem and improve the beauty of the area."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"The best mussel porridge I've ever had, it's cheap and has lots of mussels."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,The beach is ordinary... A fishing beach selling lots of seafood... but I visited in the morning
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Nice clean beach with seafood restaurant around.
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Best quiet place ever
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"The ocean view is amazing. Even the drinks are pictures... good, good, good..."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Beautiful beach, beautiful people and excellent food"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,It's a quiet beach with a local feel.
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Nice beach, pack your suncream if you burn easily haha"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Great for sea views near Hoi An
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"We went there at 10 AM and played until 2 PM, when it was the hottest. There were more foreigners than Koreans, and it was quieter and more secluded than Mikke Beach. There were a lot of cafes and restaurants with great views and a great atmosphere lining the beach, so we could order food and relax. Usually, when you order food at a restaurant near Anbang Beach, you can use everything from parasols to showers for free."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"A must-see. You can easily go by bike. In fact, I recommend it because the scenery is spectacular and you can stop off at the beach.
For three euros, you can have a sun lounger for the whole day. I was even able to buy a bikini for three euros and take advantage of the swim. Food options are everywhere, especially seafood.
For the same price, you can eat on the sun loungers on the beach."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Beautiful beach
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"The waves at Anbang Beach were high and the wind was strong, but the atmosphere of the restaurants nearby was good and there were many restaurants worth visiting around Anbang Beach."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Very beautiful, white beach. Sunbeds cost about 100,000 VND. Very safe. Not very busy. Perfect 👌"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Great seafood! Also excellent coffee!
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Great clean beach
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"it was nice, we had lovely weather the day we went (despite rainy season) plus it’s handy that they have a bar and some showers to wash off your feet or shorts etc. Only slight issue is that there’s quite a few people going around selling which is fairly normal here but just a little annoying getting offered the same bracelet 5 times 😂. Overall had a lovely time and people are generally pretty friendly. Would say it’s more a tourist spot than a hangout for the locals."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"A nice beach with good sand and sea. There are plenty of restaurants along the beach and lots of people who will constantly ask you to go to their restaurant.

On the road towards the beach there are a few bars which are a little walk always from the beach.

A free beach not yet owned by the big companies."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Excellent! Clear sea with fine sand and lots of pretty snails
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Great beach and water sports bits, awesome bars and restaurants on the shore front!"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"The water is shallow and the waves are calm, so it would be nice to play when the weather is nice."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"An Bang Beach in Hoi An is a beautiful and relaxing spot with soft sand and clear water. It’s a great place to swim, walk, or just unwind by the sea. There are plenty of beachside cafes and restaurants where you can grab a drink or meal while enjoying the view. It can get a bit crowded later in the day, but the atmosphere is laid-back and friendly. A perfect place to spend a sunny afternoon in Hoi An."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Won’t stay anywhere else this was a perfect location on the beach food menus was a welcome change with a few home comforts on there.. 🙈 don’t judge… could recommend the staff Enough we arrived at 6.00am early and Emily got out of bead and rushed to looked after us and did not stop the whole stay. Will sort you with anything you need at all makes staying a dream…
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Awesome beach you can rent surfboard Bodyboard launch chairs close to restaurant and shops
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,Water was clear! And a lot of restaurants offering beds
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,A place with beautiful beaches and many cafes
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"I really like the feeling of standing in front of the sea here. The sea is clear blue, the sand is white and smooth, the waves are gentle and very pleasant. The cool sea breeze makes me feel comfortable and relaxed. The space is quiet, not too crowded so it feels very peaceful. Walking along the sandy beach, watching the sea and breathing the fresh air is really pleasant."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,A great place to surf
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Wide, expansive golden sands meet calm waters (not the clearest, but overall fine)—perfect for relaxing strolls. Super pleasant vibe with tons of beachfront restaurants offering fresh eats right on the sand. Rented a surfboard easily and had a blast catching waves. Highly recommend!"
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"The beach is a bit “mid” because there is no public area along it. You need to go through an alley way between shops to get to the sand. 10 metres of open public space, like a promenade or boardwalk would vitalise the area. A great example in Vietnam are the beaches of DaNang like Mykhe beach. Even though there is intense development the space along the foreshore makes it very pleasant."
ChIJq5ZTbfkNQjER77EyOpeeDe0,"Clean, beautiful stretch of beach. Warm water, soft sand, and calm waves perfect for the whole family. Plenty of good restaurants lined along the beach, if you order food from them then you dont have to pay the lounger and umbrella.

We are lucky that we are staying just a good 5 minutes walk away from the beach. During our stay, we get to do our early morning walk and swim in the morning."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Best place that feels relax, neat and clean."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Da Nang beach is clean, clear water, fine sand. Swimming in the early morning is extremely pleasant, truly a destination worth experiencing! 🌊"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"One of the most beautiful beaches in Vietnam! Da Nang beach is wide, airy, has a separate bathing area for tourists, and has lifeguards on duty for safety. Nearby are many hotels, beachside cafes and great places to take photos. Anyone who comes to Da Nang should definitely visit My Khe beach at least once."

ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,Clean and beautiful
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"A blue beach in the middle of the city. This beach is incredibly beautiful.

If you want to see the best spots, it's best to visit in June or July. December is when the waves are usually big, making the sea water murky.

In the mornings, it's bustling with locals exercising. Vietnamese people are very into sports."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"It's truly wonderful, one of the most beautiful beaches in Vietnam as well as in the world, clean, smooth sand, moderate waves, flat beach, blue water, great view, clean beach, well maintained"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,Beautiful beach!!!
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"About a five-minute walk from my hotel, I visited the famous My Khe Beach. The sand was so fine and soft that many people walked barefoot. The sea breeze was refreshing, and the sound of the waves was soothing.

Early in the morning, it was bustling with people strolling, swimming, and surfing, but the atmosphere was lively and pleasant. It was the perfect place to start my day in Da Nang.

Just a five-minute walk from my hotel, I visited the famous My Khe Beach. The sand is incredibly fine and soft, so many people were walking barefoot along the shore. The sea breeze was cool and refreshing, and the sound of the waves was soothing.

Even early in the morning, the beach was full of energy—people jogging, swimming, and surfing. Despite the crowds, the atmosphere felt relaxed and vibrant at the same time. It's truly one of the best spots to start your morning in Da Nang."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"My Khe Beach at 10:30 on October 22, 2025, before storm No. 12 combined with increased cold air, the provinces from Quang Tri to Da Nang city in the afternoon had winds gradually increasing to level 6, sometimes level 7, gusting to level 8-9."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,Good beach..clean
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,The beach scenery was very pretty.
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,Very beautiful and peaceful
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,The beach is clean and beautiful. The people are also very nice.
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Gorgeous beach
The lifeguard puts up red flags, go spend a nice day at the beach, and can’t swim.
If you have a boogie or a surf board you can, everyone else that enters the water the lifeguard is blowing his whistle.   Go further up , same beach   The lifeguard there doesn’t close off the water"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Clean and beautiful sea, calm beach at night, worth the experience"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"The golden moon shines
The mirror-like sea
The silver waves crash on the shore
Whose boat is casting its net?"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,Such a beautiful place it was! You can also do some water sports like parasailing here. The place was crowded but then too the beach and the streets were so clean. In the evening the place was really very happening.
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"12 years ago and now the same, Danang people are very friendly, beautiful beach"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Beautiful sea, clear water"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,AWesome
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"I went to My Khe Beach - Da Nang in the summer and was really impressed with the fine white sand, clear blue water, and moderate waves. The coastal area is very clean, with a regular cleaning team and a professionally organized public bathing area. 

The sunrise in the morning is extremely beautiful, many people bathe early or exercise on the beach, the air is fresh and pleasant. 

However, during peak season, there are quite a lot of visitors, especially in the evening, so it is a bit noisy and difficult to find a parking space. 

In return, near the beach there are many cafes, delicious seafood restaurants, reasonable prices, friendly service. 

Overall, Da Nang beach deserves to be one of the most beautiful and worth-experiencing beaches in Vietnam. 🌊"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,I like walking along the beach
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,This is the main Beach area. Can get a little crowded but great place to swim and surf.
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,My Khe dep vcl😍😍
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,MUKSH
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,Pleasant beach with palms and lots of places around the boulevard to sit down have a drink or grab a bite. Even got at a good time to see (and help!) the fishermen pull out the fishing nets
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Every morning and evening, it's bustling with locals exercising, so we can join in too.

I tried joining in, and it was so tiring I couldn't finish. 😂

Vietnamese people really love exercise, and the government even provides facilities. 👍🏻

If you don't want to exercise, just sitting around is really nice here. 🤣🤣"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,Fuck it!
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Very nice
My home town
Love it"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"It's a lovely, quiet beach.
It was wonderful to spend time relaxing and gazing at the ocean."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"The morning air is very fresh, very suitable for watching the sunrise, exercising, swimming, visiting and buying seafood, pulling nets in the morning. Very wonderful."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Top clean and beautiful beaches in Vietnam. Strolling along the beach to enjoy the cool breeze, listening to the murmuring waves or immersing yourself in the cool blue sea water is a wonderful experience not only for locals but also for tourists from all over."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,The best beach in the world
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"10/6 Full Moon and Poodle-Shaped Clouds
A Wide, Beautiful Sea"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,The most beautiful beaches I have ever been to
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"I just want to say, this is all so beautiful! A must-do in Da Nang. For those working long hours and needing a quiet and relaxing place to refresh their souls, Da Nang Beach 🏖️ is definitely the perfect choice. There are plenty of drinks for sale 🥤 and lounge chairs for those looking out at the ocean. It's truly relaxing, and just staring at the ocean and letting your mind wander is a kind of spiritual healing. Everyone here is very disciplined, and the beach is incredibly clean. I won't be able to comment on this personally in the future, but for now, it's all wonderful to me. I sincerely hope you'll come and take a look 👀"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,beautiful beach
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,I like
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"I took a Grab from my accommodation in Da Nang City to My Khe Beach. The best destination is ""the beach across from the M Hotel."" A surfing school operates on the beach across from the M Hotel, and a long rope marks the safety zone, making swimming only permitted here. Lifeguards are also on duty, which is why so many people flock here. Herbal Pizza is nearby, so you can enjoy pizza or steak with beer while watching the sunset. It's also fascinating to see vacationers from all over the world enjoying themselves in various ways. The beach stretches for 33 kilometers, which is impressive. I happened to spot a gorgeous girl practicing her dance moves on the beach (video available). I wish her a wonderful future."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"I went there in the early evening of October. Miraculously, it was sunny and cool. It was a fantastical space, lined with bars and massage parlors and many people relaxing on the sand. If it's sunny, it's a place worth strolling in the evening or at night."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Danang is home to the stunning My Khe Beach, considered one of the most natural beaches. My Khe is a popular destination among tourists to relax, have fun, and enjoy the seabreeze. Locals flocks to the area as well for their daily exercises and outdoor activities.

The beach is known for its long stretch of fine white sands and the picturesque boardwalk. The gentle waves is great for swimming and relaxing. You can chill at a lounger chair while sipping on your favorite drinks."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"I went there every morning during my four-day stay in Da Nang.
This beach is a perfect place to experience the local atmosphere.
It's bustling from 4 a.m.: people exercising, fishing, seniors swimming with plastic bottles in their hands, locals enjoying sand baths and sunbathing, YouTubers filming, couples... The sea is also less hot in the early morning, and the sea of ​​Da Nang locals and foreigners mix, creating their own unique waves. I really love this beach, where the waves, sunrises, and the daily lives and travels of the people all intermingle."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"It was a light rain, but the beach was beautiful. If I come here again, I'd like to stay at a hotel along the beach."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"🍃Environment:
The coastline is truly long.
We came here to catch the sunrise, but it was cloudy after the rain that morning, so we couldn't see it. The few people watching were probably tourists.
5. When it was busy, some people were already showering 🚿 and doing morning exercises. It felt like most of the place was local.
Although it's considered one of the ""six best beaches in the world,"" aside from the soft sand perfect for lounging on a lounge chair, I haven't yet discovered its beauty. I hope to visit again someday."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"one of Da Nang’s most beautiful spots — clean sand, clear water, and a relaxing vibe. Perfect for swimming, walking, or watching the sunset. 🌅🌴"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"At first glance, I thought I was Korean... Looking at the palm trees, I guess I'm overseas...
The palm trees made for a nice walk... Honestly, I didn't want to go into the ocean. There are public restrooms, but during the day, you see things like cockroaches, but at night, they're gone."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,great
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"It was a very beautiful sandy beach and I was glad that it was close to the hotel where I was staying. 
I didn't go in, but I'd like to go next time."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"My Khe Beach is beautiful and very clean, with soft white sand and clear blue water. It’s a great place to relax, walk along the shore, or watch the sunrise. The beach is quite long and not too crowded, even during the day. There are also plenty of cafés and local food stalls nearby. Overall, it’s one of the nicest beaches I’ve visited in Vietnam! 🌊☀️"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Stayed in Da Nang 1 month, came to this beach 6 times a week, soo nice and relaxing."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Really beautiful and peaceful beach. It’s clean, quiet, and not crowded even in the morning. The sand is soft and the water is clear, with barely any trash around which is nice to see.

I went for a walk here around sunrise and it was super calming — just the sound of waves and a few locals jogging or swimming. Definitely one of the nicer beaches I’ve been to in Vietnam. Perfect spot to relax and unwind."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"A beautiful beach, even in the evening with the lighting, very nice, very clean and not extremely crowded with tourists, as is the case in European countries."

ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Clean and beautiful beach, clear prices, no haggling"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"An ordinary sea like all seas, its color is gray. I came in the winter season!! There are no services or chairs, and I did not feel that it was a tourist sea and that they did not care about tourists. As I said, I came in the winter season, so it might be closed or something, I do not know."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Mesmerizing and super clean beach with fine sand, superb view of the surrounding buildings and coastline. No wonder this is dubbed as the Asia equivalent of Miami."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Clean, long beach. Still wild and simple."
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,So beautiful

ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"Clean beach, has parking for tourists to stop and check in quickly. Very beautiful view!"
ChIJ4w7694IXQjERrFXucqKL--o,"My Khe Beach is known as one of the most beautiful beaches on the planet, with clear blue water, fine white sand and poetic coconut trees. This place is very suitable for swimming, relaxing, participating in water sports and watching the beautiful sunrise. Developed tourism services, many delicious seafood restaurants, fresh air, is a destination not to be missed when coming to Da Nang."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Cheap, fun and worth experiencing, can go boating, snorkeling, boating, playing, photo shoot location for girls"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,A good place for snorkeling
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Pretty
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"The rocky beach and bathing area are quite private, so you should go early in the morning or at noon because it is less crowded. In the afternoon, it is quite crowded and noisy. Visitors come to take pictures, check in and eat and drink quite chaotically. There are no bathrooms or toilets. The place to rent a mat is quite dirty and the price of fresh water to shower is 100K."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Beautiful place. To go to the beach, first the map location takes you to the end of the road where you can park and from there it's a small hike down to get to the rock beach. Most of the people come there to take pictures. The view is serene and peaceful"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Beautiful as it was originally
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Coral diving service is booming, very crowded with customers"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"One of the best beaches in Danang, but a bit remote."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Arrived and found it worse than the advertised pictures.
Still simple
Takes pictures okay"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"The beach is quite beautiful, so you should go early if you don't want to accidentally get in someone else's photo. The first day I went at 4:30 pm, it was super crowded with people taking photos. The next day, I went at 3 am and it was a bit better, the beach goes deeper inside (looks like an egg rock beach), the sand is finer, more enjoyable to swim than the outer beach with rocks that hurt my feet.
I encountered a case where renting a mat cost 180k nationwide. My girlfriend paid 500, she returned 220k, asked if it was enough, my girlfriend said: 100k less, she laughed and said ""scary clever"" ??? :D If it weren't for the beautiful beach, I probably wouldn't have come back again"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Beautiful rocky beach, there is a service to rent mats to rest here."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Nice place
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Beautiful scenery, fresh air blends with nature very beautifully. I just passed by but couldn't help but stop to take pictures of the beauty. Please come here!"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,So beautifull
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Beautiful and quiet scenery.
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"The rocky beach is very beautiful for taking pictures. 
In 2024, I went without paying for parking (parking in an empty lot). 
In 2025, someone came to collect tickets but there was no sign. If it is a city policy, it is fine. But if it is collected by the people themselves, I hope the government will consider it."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"If you have time and means to go to Da Nang, try this area. Taking pictures is also beautiful, playing games is quite cheap, and there are many monkeys too."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Super beautiful rocky beach. Check in and burn your phone. You can rent mats, order drinks, food, grilled squid, etc. at very cheap prices. Million dollar view"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Absolutely beautiful, for nature lovers"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Beautiful should try
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,It's very interesting here
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"We arrived there after being refused so many times on the other beach or asked to drink something to get access to the beach
In Bai Da beach it was completly different, the local were friendly and asked us if we wanted a benchtop for the afternoon, we paid 200k VND.
You can easily go swim, there is some boat coming by to collect some clients but they always check where you're at."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,It was not like Google. Don't come here. Disappointed.
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"I went from My Khe to here. This was easy to find, easy to find. Parking fee is 10k/bike. I went here for diving and this was amazing experience for me. I highly recommend Mr. Truong (i will put his contact right below), he and his teammates were so friendly and nice. My diving combo included teaching, taking pictures and videos and editing it."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Quiet place. Clean water. There are no houses anymore, like in the old photos. You can grill shashlik. There are grills and a barbecue. There are SUPs for rent. They sell mats for 200K. No choice. You want to put your blanket on something. They sold ice cream. Only 15K. It's definitely worth a visit once. And this is where the locals relax."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,The rocky beach has crystal clear water. Very beautiful. It would be a waste to just come here to take pictures. Bring your swimsuit. The calm waves and clear water here are great.
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"I came here to rent a stall and it was quiet and cool, but the scenery was so beautiful.
Recommend for those who want to be wild enough but not climb steep slopes like Ghenh Bang"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,so chill
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Parking is 10K. Bring your own clothes to swim. They charge a separate fee for renting a tent.

This place is probably suitable for those who want to escape deadlines, stress, and the question of 'when will you get married' during the summer!

A peaceful place with enough energy to 'recharge' yourself"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Ideal for camping and playing water games ❤️
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"easy to get to, quite beautiful at sunset. mat rental 70k, add stove to grill food 30k"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Looking at these scenes, I feel the wild, majestic and peaceful beauty of nature here.

a vast space of the ocean. The dark blue water stretches to the horizon, where the high-rise buildings of Da Nang city appear dimly under the mist. The gray-white sky with layered clouds creates a feeling of stillness and silence. The small kayak in the distance further highlights the vastness of the ocean. I can imagine the gentle sound of waves and the gentle sea breeze

The scene becomes closer and more impressive with large gray-brown rocks stacked on top of each other naturally. Two people stand on the cliff, small in the majestic space of mountains and ocean. Behind are lush, green mountains, creating a beautiful background for the photo. The clear blue sky with fluffy white clouds brings a bright and airy feeling. This photo reminds me of the strength and resilience of nature and the smallness of humans in front of that beauty.
The third photo brings a different perspective, more gentle and relaxing. The smooth golden sand embraces the clear blue sea, the small waves gently lapping the shore creating a soothing sound. The green trees along the coast are like a soft silk strip. The blue sky with thin white clouds creates a peaceful space, ideal for relaxing and enjoying the beauty of the ocean.
Overall, the three photos vividly depict the diverse beauty of Bai Da in Son Tra Peninsula. From the vastness and tranquility of the ocean to the majesty of the mountains and the tranquility of the sand, each frame has its own nuances, but all exude the wild and charming beauty of Da Nang's nature. I believe that, when you set foot here, you will feel many more wonderful things that these photos only partially reveal."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,A quiet village. Usually local people come. A great place to swim.
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Dirty, lots of trash, 10k bus ticket, won't come back"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"There's absolutely no point in coming here. The locals charge 10,000 rubles for entry. There are tons of monkeys around, so it's best to walk with a stick to keep them away. You probably won't be able to swim here—there are too many rocks and it's dirty. Locals do take photos here, but I don't know why anyone would come just for them. It's nothing special. We spent about three minutes and left."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"They say you have to go after 4 p.m. to see the monkeys.

The water bottle and the tree seat cost a total of 700,000 dong."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"The environment is disgusting, parking a scooter costs 10,000 dong"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Perhaps this is the easiest beach to get to on Son Tra peninsula. There is an asphalt road all the way inside, and on the dirt road there are stairs leading down to the beach. It feels like there are residents exploiting this area.

But that's true, as soon as we got down there were people offering kayaking, coral diving, canoeing, banana floats, a combo for 350k. But I saw that these were spontaneous packages and there was no rescuer, so I didn't buy them.

The landscape is very beautiful, it is a natural rocky beach, there are reefs under the sea so it is best not to bathe here. The weathered rock is uneven, some are sharp, some are flat, some are cracked, some are smooth, adding to its wildness and uniqueness.

The sea water is clear, blue, and the sea breeze blows briskly.

The sea and rocky beaches are vast, watching the scenery is very comfortable and relieves stress.

The minus point is that people camp a lot in this area but do not clean up the trash, the road is dirty."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"The beach is a wonderful destination with clear blue water, soft sand and quiet space, very suitable for relaxing and enjoying nature. The landscape here is highly appreciated by many people for its wild beauty, not too crowded, along with rows of green coconut trees creating a poetic picture. However, some visitors commented that the road to the beach is still a bit bumpy, and convenient services such as restaurants or resorts are not yet well developed. However, this is still an ideal choice for those who want to explore and experience a vacation close to the sea."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"We paid 10,000 VDN to park the motorcycle, but the space itself was very poorly maintained, with plastics and trash everywhere and no cafes or services to relax by the sea. Overall, the space has great potential but is poorly maintained."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"**Review of Bai Da - Da Nang**

Bai Da is one of the lesser-known tourist destinations in Da Nang, but it offers a wonderful experience for those who love the wild and peaceful beauty of nature. Located about 20km from the city center, Bai Da is an ideal choice for those who want to explore deserted beaches and enjoy a quiet space, different from other crowded beaches in Da Nang.

### **Scenery and nature**

The first thing that makes a strong impression when coming to Bai Da is its wild and peaceful beauty. Although not too prominent in terms of tourism development, Bai Da still possesses an irresistible natural beauty with fine golden sand, clear blue sea water and large scattered stones creating a unique landscape. If you love taking photos, this is the perfect place to create great photos with the blue sea and natural rocks.

### **Wild and deserted nature**

Unlike crowded beaches like My Khe or Non Nuoc, Bai Da has a quiet and deserted space, a great destination for those who want to find a place to relax and get away from the noise. This is an ideal place for you to swim, walk on the sand or simply enjoy the peaceful space and listen to the sound of the waves.

### **Activities at Bai Da**

Although Bai Da does not have many services like other beaches in Da Nang, this place is very suitable for activities such as swimming, walking on the sand or participating in outdoor games. The large rocks also create an ideal space for you to climb and admire the sea view from above. In addition, this is also an ideal place for picnics or short camping trips if you love to immerse yourself in nature.

### **Location and how to get there**

Bai Da is located about 20km northeast of Da Nang city center, near Son Tra peninsula. To get to Bai Da, you can travel by motorbike or car. Although there are no clear signs, you can easily find your way through the routes near Son Tra peninsula. However, if you are not familiar with the road, you may need support from a map or local people.

### **Things to note**

- **Limited facilities:** Because it is a pristine beach, Bai Da does not have many facilities to serve tourists like other areas. Therefore, if you plan to come here, prepare food, drinks and necessary items.

- **Safety:** Because it is a deserted beach, you need to pay attention to safety when swimming, especially on days with big waves.

### **Summary**

Da Nang Rock Beach is an ideal destination for those who want to find peace and immerse themselves in nature. With its pristine scenery, clear blue water and deserted sand, this place will bring you a relaxing experience that is completely different from other bustling beaches. If you are a lover of tranquility and want to have a relaxing day in the middle of nature, Rock Beach will be a great choice."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Because it's located a bit further from the popular Da Nang Beach, it's less crowded and less crowded. The water is cleaner and quieter. However, the lack of amenities may be a bit inconvenient for Koreans. You'll also see a fair number of monkeys. You can enjoy banana boating, jet skiing, and snorkeling. While Grab is a convenient way to get here from the city, you should be aware that it's difficult to use Grab to hail a motorbike or car on the way back."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Don't pay for parking. It's a public beach. They don't have a license
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"The road to Son Tra peninsula is mostly easy to go, many mountains so there are many slopes, some warning signs NO MOTORBIKES, but in reality there are still a lot of people bringing them up😅. When you get to the rock beach, there are people guarding the vehicles for 10k/motorbike. There are a lot of monkeys, they really don't like people.

Not a very good impression, a lot of trash thrown around. Saw a service for renting mats, canoeing, kayaking is also good. It's the beginning of the week but it's very crowded, most of the Vietnamese take virtual photos (should wear white or light-colored clothes to stand out more).

From here on the right is Linh Ung pagoda, the scene of the guys fishing is very chill, on a drizzly day, there are clouds automatically available."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Nice beach
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Bai Da Beach aka Obama Rock Beach is a rocky beach with that wild, untouched beauty but the trash situation is SO disappointing.

My heart broke stepping over dead corals, plastic water bottles and bags, face masks, beer cans and seeing a monkey drinking from a plastic bag of soy sauce—a sign that it was desperate for food. Let’s plant banana trees so they can eat the way nature intended.

Today, our little crew cleaned up and hauled out two giant bags of garbage, but this shouldn’t fall on travelers. This beach deserves recycling bins, proper waste management, and a little love from those who enjoy it. Thanks to the Korean tourist who helped us pick up trash today."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"A rocky beach accessible by foot for three minutes from the parking lot. It's all littered, a shame, and it's not a pleasure to stay there. It's also not easy to access the water."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Be sure to bring bananas when you come here haha. There are a lot of monkeys. It's fun. And it's good if you rent a motorcycle. Grab is hard to get.
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Beauty scene
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"A beach with a paid entrance, where locals catch crabs. Swimming there wasn't very comfortable for me because of the many rocks. But the views are beautiful."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,The location didn't work out very well.
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"It's much further away from the city than the Oike location, so I almost ran out of time to write an essay. But it takes a lot of time, so you can't go without a bike or car. I think it takes about an hour from the city."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,The place is beautiful but going there you need to walk down and there are no landmarks or walkways.. no entrance fee.. but you need to book a car or contact your grab to wait.. Drivers will wait for you without any extra charge. Also they can show you the location.. we’re having a great day here..
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Has so much potential but the rubbish on the beach is shocking. Don't bother
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"A quite interesting and wild place in Son Tra with the road leading to it full of monkeys hahaha. The plus point is that the free beach is not as strict as the inner city so you can bring your dog to play. Someone put some bricks on the cliff and from afar it looks like Buddha meditating, very interesting. The minus point is that the beach has many real rocks so it is a bit small and there are too many young people jostling to take wedding photos or swimsuit photos..."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"You can park your scooter further up and pay 10,000 VND. Or you can continue to the right and get a good bit closer. The path and the forest behind the beach are pretty dirty. My wife spent an hour collecting trash. But the beach and the water are very beautiful. There was trash on the beach, but not much.

Snorkeling was very nice. I had pretty clear visibility that day. The people there were a bit reserved. But we didn't demand their help."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Amazing!!!!
A deserted bathing spot with few people, importantly, it looks more wild than bathing at a normal beach. Many foreigners also come here to bathe. They bathe on one side separately and on the other side, Vietnamese people turn on speakers and sing loud karaoke.

The road up is easy, motorbikes keep 10k but cars don't. I don't know if there are grass and mats spread out on the ground for people to have a picnic and have a place to sit for a fee. There is a shelter to change clothes, fresh water to shower, SUP paddles, life jackets and canoe service.
It's quite crowded on weekends, especially in the afternoon around 5pm and there will still be more people coming. The scenery is so beautiful, I don't know how to describe it, it looks like Hawaii :))))
Bathing near pebbles is good, there is also seaweed, very shallow, there are a lot of waves crashing in and out and the water swirls in a few places.

The important thing is: keep this place clean, bring back whatever you bring.

Update: On July 28, when I went around, the girls collected trash and burned it in the bushes. When bathing in the sea, they had to cover their mouths and noses due to the strong smell of smoke. The scenery was natural, but many people used speakers to sing karaoke, polluting the sound. Noisy, extremely uncomfortable, lots of trash. I'm afraid this site is closed."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Easy to cycle to from Da Nang city. Free to enter. You might even see a few nice fish if you're lucky! A little litter. To the guy who wants to make this an expensive (private) resort....just think about what you're saying for a moment! Do you really want to deprive poorer folk the opportunity to fish, swim and dive???Numpty! 😁"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Payed 110000 Dong for parking and entrance. You get a matt to lay on. Rather loud music and no Sand beach.
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,crowded beach and lots of trash. one side is blocked by the resort
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,very expensive
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,It was just beautiful. I swam nearby again.
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Avoid them, they charge tourists 50K."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Beautiful scenery but no one manages it, very dirty, there are diving shops, but it seems like they don't eat well."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Good to go
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"The beach is clean and beautiful.
No more services as advertised in the media.
Lots of monkeys"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,You can come take pictures. The area is quite deserted.
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Pretty nice beach :)
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,The wildness and lack of services necessary for a tourist destination. Corals need to be protected from waste.
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"This is a beautiful place with clear blue water and pristine rocky beaches creating a lively summer scene. When I went, there were few people and few waves, so it was super beautiful and easy to take pictures. Near the shore there is a large seaweed beach."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"The scenery is beautiful, everyone with small children should go so be careful to have a parking space on the side of the road to see the afternoon view towards the sea and bring along snacks or camping water, which is very reasonable. Very chill"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Great
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,So beautiful
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,So beautiful
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"You have to pay 10,000 to access a very dirty seaside. Too bad"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"A failure at all levels. Do not waste your time here.

The amount of garbage and noise from karaoke is shameful. Some locals don't know how to appreciate the natural beauty of their country and just treat this as a garbage dump for all kinds of plastic. The photos you see here do not show the reality of what this place is.

The police should be stationed permanently to scare people into behaving civilly or, unfortunately, an expensive private resort needs to be built nearby to protect this from happening (as is the case in many places in Vietnam). I know some day this will improve in Vietnam but for now don't go to this place and be left with a terrible impression of Vietnam...it's better to stick to Da Nang beach or An Bang beach."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Too many people carrying speakers and littering on the beach! So sad! 😞
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"The atmosphere is nice, but the accommodation fee is too expensive."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,See you soon
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"The beautiful rocky beach retains its natural beauty. If you bring food and drinks, please don't litter. There are a lot of monkeys on the island."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Return to the wild and hidden beauty
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Dirty, full of rubbish & no sand - waste of 10k"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Suitable for check in
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Small rocky beach, you can walk on rocks and see crabs running away :) easy to get to, worth a visit👍"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"The beach is clean and the sand is white. Many people come for picnics and do not litter! Note that the government no longer allows businesses here. When you come here, you should prepare food and drinks, and have fresh water available for bathing 🛀 🆓."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Closed nothing, no restaurant, lots of trash"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"This area is quite suitable for fishing because of the rocks, so the seafood here is very good."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Bai Da is famous for its majestic and wild beauty. When I arrived here, I was amazed by the fine white sand like the essence, sipping the salty sea scent. The unique style of the rock scene, the rocky cliffs create a harmonious natural picture. The emerald green sea blends with the deep blue sky, creating a vast and quiet space. The white clouds floating in the sky make the scene more poetic. Bai Da is an ideal destination for those who want to get away from the dust of the city, immerse themselves in the peaceful space of the ocean and natural jade rocks."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"The scenery is breathtaking 💯
I came at sunset and during the pandemic, so there weren't many activities. I heard from the owner that on weekends, they usually rent tents to sleep overnight, and they also sell food, suitable for groups of friends and families who want to find a place to relax and relieve stress after a stressful week of work 👏"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Too much
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Follow the mountain road past the Lady Buddha and then take the road that leads off to the right a couple of kilometres later. The end of that road turns into a track down to this gloriously secluded cove. Yes, you will be pestered for a parking fee; yes, there is a fair bit of rubbish to be found on the beach and in the sea; yes, there are very dangerous sharp rocks and jagged bits of metal sticking out all over the place which could do you serious harm; and yes, it does get horribly crowded at weekends when hoards of “mot-hai-ba” partygoers descend like a plague of locusts….but trust me, despite these irritants, this place is gorgeous. The sea is so much cleaner and clearer than anywhere along the Danang-to-Hoi An beach line, you can snorkel and view pretty coral and a wide range of beautiful fish, it has a less touristy, more serene atmosphere than other beaches in this area, and best of all, there are no lifeguards shouting at you and blowing a whistle to make you move from one arbitrarily designated ‘safe zone’ to another one, just so the lifeguard can feel big and powerful.
This is a great place to bring a picnic and some beers and chill out for a whole day, but please, please take your rubbish with you when you leave."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Obama Rock Beach is located on Son Tra Peninsula in Da Nang, near the most sacred Linh Ung Pagoda that every tourist visiting Da Nang must visit. Previously, this rock beach was not a famous destination, only used by local people for fishing. However, after the development of Da Nang tourism, especially in the nearby areas such as Linh Ung Pagoda and Ban Co Peak, Obama Rock Beach also became a part of the tourism development. 

The city has recognized its potential and invested in developing tourism services in this area. As a result, Obama Rock Beach has become a unique and unmissable destination for tourists exploring Da Nang. Despite human intervention and development, it still retains the delicacy and purity of a pristine beach, nestled in the natural beauty of the landscape."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Ok! Nice view!
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"The guy collecting money for his ""parking services"" should instead make himself useful and pick up some trash. The coral is 99% dead, the only colorful things you'll see in the water are beer cans. Not suitable to swim for beginners as it's easy to cut yourself on the rocks and coral. It's okay for taking pictures."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"Obama Rock Beach is located on Son Tra Peninsula - Da Nang, near the most sacred pagoda that every time tourists visit and experience Da Nang, they must visit Linh Ung Pagoda. Previously, this rock beach was not known to tourists, only people living near this Obama Rock area often came to fish. But later, because Da Nang City has developed tourism, some recent areas such as Linh Ung Pagoda, Ban Co Peak are famous with tourists, this Obama Rock Beach has also ""influenced"" the investor to exploit and develop some tourism services at this location. Later, it became a new check-in tourist destination in Da Nang that tourists cannot miss and was also voted as one of the places that still retains the wild simplicity of the natural landscape despite the ""sculpture"" of humans."
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"- The rocky beach is very beautiful, you should try it
- The road to get there is very easy (by motorbike), then park your car outside the beach (parking man 10k/car).
- The walking path down is not steep, easy to walk, small children can still go
- At the beach, there are coral diving, sub-rowing, canoeing services for those who want to explore, the rest can just sightsee, free"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"The road to get here is quite beautiful
The water is clear and suitable for coral diving. There is a place here that exploits and rents diving equipment, but personally I find it unsanitary at all. Anyone who wants to dive can bring their own equipment. I read a lot of news about coral exploitation in Son Tra peninsula and I find it quite negative, so everyone should consider reading before choosing whether to buy the service here or not. The area near the coral boat seems to have only about 40% left because of uncontrolled exploitation. Also note that the water level is quite low, so if you stand, you will step on the coral. This clip was filmed by me swimming a little further away from the boat, so the coral is still healthy, mainly quite beautiful table coral. I think 450k is cheap.

I have shared about tourist destinations in Vietnam on the instagram page lenrung_xuongbien, the page is still very new but promises quality 🥰 Please visit"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"A corner of the rocky beach, this place is quite beautiful, suitable for young people with a free spirit and love nature
Suitable to come early in the morning before sunrise
Ps you should collect your trash when you come here, otherwise after a while there will be nothing left but trash"
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,Beautiful beach but it’s ruined by the stupid water scooter who comes every 5 minutes and endanger swimmers and snorkels.
ChIJDQ1kHicWQjERfOaeeBK3t7E,"The beach is beautiful and pristine, but for a long time it was occupied and illegally built into a tourist attraction. Now it has been demolished, but the old establishments still try to cling on to do business. The entrance fee to swim in the sea is 20k/person, quite expensive. The beach is littered with bricks and rubble. The freshwater bathing area, as they say, is a few pillars surrounded by tarpaulins, and a water tap. 😅😅😅🙃, not worth the price of 20k/person. If you want to swim in the sea, you should not come here. The beaches are only about 10k for comfortable swimming and fresh water bathing."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,Pretty
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Kỳ Co Beach, located near Nhơn Lý in Quy Nhơn, is often called the “Maldives of Vietnam” for its crystal-clear turquoise waters and powdery white sand. Nestled between rugged mountains and the sea, the beach feels like a hidden paradise, offering both dramatic scenery and tranquil beauty.

For photographers, Kỳ Co is a dream destination. The contrast between the emerald sea, golden sand, and rocky cliffs creates striking compositions. Aerial shots with a drone capture the full curve of the shoreline, while sunrise and sunset provide soft, golden light that enhances the natural colors. The shallow waters near the shore are incredibly clear, perfect for capturing reflections and underwater scenes.

Beyond its beauty, Kỳ Co offers opportunities for snorkeling, swimming, and exploring nearby coves, adding variety to both travel experiences and photo stories. Local seafood stalls near the beach provide a cultural touch, where visitors can enjoy freshly prepared dishes against the backdrop of the ocean.

Kỳ Co Beach is more than just a seaside escape—it is a destination where unspoiled nature meets vibrant coastal life. For travelers and photographers, it remains one of the most captivating beaches in central Vietnam."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"It’s nothing special, honestly. Going after October, there’s not much to do, you just go down there, take some photos, enjoy the view, and that’s about it. The ticket costs 170,000 VND, which feels a bit overpriced just to take pictures and leave. It’s also normal, nothing special, going at this time (after October) there’s nothing to do, just go down to see the scenery, take pictures and then go back. Buying a ticket for 170,000 to go down, take pictures and then go back is a bit of a waste of money"
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,Very beautiful
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Kỳ Co Beach is absolutely beautiful! 🏝️
Clear turquoise water, soft white sand, and stunning mountain views all around. The place is quite clean and well-maintained — definitely worth a visit when in Quy Nhơn! 🌊☀️✨"
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Ky Co Beach in Phu Yen is really beautiful, the sea water is clear blue, the sand is white and smooth. The beach is clean, suitable for swimming and taking virtual photos. The travel is a bit far but the scenery is worth experiencing. Will definitely come back when I have the chance!"
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Beach itself is lovely with clear water, clean smooth sand, but the experience of being charged for entrance/parking/transport to just get to the beach which should be a publicly accessible place leaves a sour taste unfortunately. Sun-beds with shade are also pricey…"
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Beautiful beach, tourist exploitation fee is 167k, nothing else, besides the entrance fee, all services inside are also charged."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Beautiful scenery, clear water. Worth the experience"
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,Pretty
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Okay, but there's no place to rest and the amenities are so lacking that I can't stay there."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,The water is much clearer than Quy Nhon city.
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,So beautiful
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Near Nhon Ly there is an entrance gate (on the left side along the entrance road), ticket is more than 100k, drive straight to the parking lot, easy to go. Then take the tram down to the beach area, the road is steep. Beautiful scenery, white sand, creating many photo shoots, clear blue water. There is a very beautiful small waterfall. Clean restroom. Truly a resort. Inside there is a hotel, homestay... Price from 1.5 million/day."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Clean beach with clear water. Some services are provided like place to sit, water sports and seal circuits for children but not the top quality."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"It's a very beautiful beach, highly recommended. Clean, beautiful sand. First, you need to get to the checkpoint and buy tickets. Then it's a 4-km ride. There are a lot of hills uphill, so our electric bike couldn't handle it; we had to push it, which was tough. After 4 km, there's a 10,000 parking lot, and you can take the shuttle (free). The shuttle takes you down a couple of minutes. Then just go down the stairs and you're at the beach. We really liked it; the water was clean and warm."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Beautiful sea, clear blue water, white sand and yellow sunshine"

ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"This beach is great. Admission for two is 170,000 VND. Parasols are 300,000 VND. The water is clear, making it great for snorkeling. There are changing rooms and showers. It was just okay."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Beautiful sea. Can be reached by road, through the mountain road, overlooking the sea and the wind power is great."

Beautiful scenery and clear water"
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"This place is absolutely not like the pictures anymore. First, you’re forced to pay a 170,000 VND entry fee just to access the resort because the beach is on private property. The man at the gate was rude and racist, and on top of that, he wouldn’t even let me in without finding my own transport for the 5km ride inside. I had to flag down a ride from the main road just to get there.

The road is terrible—under construction and poorly paved the entire way. After about 2km, my ride refused to continue, so I was left waiting while the so-called shuttle staff were all asleep. Eventually, one driver woke up and finally took me down.

When I reached the beach, it was another disappointment. They charge 300,000 VND for loungers, and the cove that looked so beautiful online was filthy in reality. The water was full of garbage, blue jellyfish, and even tar that stuck all over my feet. It was disgusting.

Overall, this was one of the most disappointing experiences I’ve had in Vietnam. It’s a complete tourist trap—expensive, misrepresented, and not worth your time. Avoid it."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"It's been a while since I've been back, the scenery is the same, still beautiful as ever, more services to choose from, there are hotels and resorts for guests to stay. For outside guests, the tram runs out at 5:30."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"It looks beautiful and clean, but that's all. If you charge an admission fee, you should at least maintain it!
The water is clear enough to see the bottom, but there's a lot of trash and floating debris on the surface.
I hesitate to go in.
The foreigner next to me keeps giving me the middle finger as he looks at the ocean."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"A PILE OF TRASH IN THE WATER!
It looks like a nice beach, on par with Thai beaches, white sand, clear water, but there's a ton of bags, paper, and other trash in the water. They charge 230,000 dong per person for it, plus 150,000 for a sunbed, and they can't even clean up the trash. Plus, you need another 270,000 dong for a taxi to get there. Expensive, crappy, not worth it. But there are no other clean beaches here. ""The best beach in Vietnam, the Vietnamese Maldives"" is nonsense. If you're planning a beach vacation in Vietnam, go to Thailand. If you're going to drink, welcome, it's cheap here."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Sad. I certainly underestimated it, but it's expensive for such a beach, and there's a lot of trash in the water. It was cheaper and a hundred times more beautiful in Thailand, and there was no trash. The beach was good. But Thailand overestimated the quality of its beaches. The trash in the water was especially disappointing, you swim with trash."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"beautiful. worth going. but the beach when I swam still had some trash. cigarettes, plastic bags"
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Upon entering, you'll need to pay 170,000 VND per person. Ride a motorcycle uphill, then park at the minibus stop. Pay 10,000 VND. Take the minibus to the beach. As of September 9th, there were virtually no people, the beach was clean, and you could rent a parasol for 150,000 VND for half a day. There's an outdoor shower, so bring a change of clothes and a towel."

ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,Blue sea in beautiful scenery delicious food
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,Super beautiful. Especially the small private beach on one side.
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"We took a grab-and-go boat to a restaurant that charged us 350k each for the boat ride and access to the reserve. Then we went to the beach. There are lounge chairs with straw umbrellas for 300k. On the right side of the beach are rocks and coral where we saw numerous fish while snorkeling. Around 2 pm, low tide began. We loved the beach, it was worth it. The water was clear and transparent, and the beach was clean."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Beautiful beach, amazing colours"
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Closed at 5:30 pm to ensure everyone's safety. Unfortunately, my family did not get to experience it on this trip. See you next time at Ky Co."

ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"The seawater is clear and it's a great place for swimming.
If you go to Ky Co Beach, there are cafe-restaurants by the beach where you can use lockers for a small fee. The showers are set up like outdoor stalls, but they're usable.
There will be solicitors at the ticket booth entrance, so don't follow them.
If you're arriving by motorcycle, ride up to the motorcycle parking lot near the cart service.
The last cart service is expected to be at 7 p.m.
If you're not out before then, you can walk out.

The seawater is clear and it's a great place for swimming.
If you go to Ky Co Beach, there are cafe-restaurants by the beach where you can use lockers for a small fee, and there are also showers. They're set up like outdoor stalls with partitions, but usable.
At the ticket booth entrance, there are touts trying to get you to follow them, so don't go with them. If you came by motorbike, take the cart up to the motorbike parking area where the cart service operates.
The last cart probably runs until 7 PM.
If you don’t come out before then, you may have to walk back."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,So you get to the gate and they say it's 170K to enter - fair enough. They then tell you it's 4km from the gate to the beach and you MUST have a bike or car to take you down - a bunch of guys loiter outside the gate and immediately descend on you saying they will take you the 4km for 160K (which for Vietnam taxi bike prices is an absolute con). Avoid at all costs if you care about not being treated like a cash cow. I wouldn't care if it's the most beautiful beach in the world - what they are are doing is dishonest and scummy. I literally preferred giving my grab driver 500k for the scenic round trip from Quy Nhon. Avoid!
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,Love this place so much ❤️
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,Beautiful beach
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"The road down to the beach has a beautiful view of the wind turbines. The road to the top can see the whole view of Eo Gio and the FLC area. The sea water is clean and clear. The waves are not too strong. The entrance ticket to the beach including the transportation up and down is 170k/person. There is free fresh water shower. The price to rent a beach hut is 300k/hut. When coming to Quy Nhon, you must come to this place. I will come back soon."

ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"The beauty of Ky Co:
Beach:
Ky Co has one side facing the sea and the other three sides leaning against the mountains, creating a wild and peaceful space.
Seawater:
The seawater in Ky Co is as clear as jade, you can see the bottom.
White sand:
The sand in Ky Co is white and smooth, stretching along the coast.
Rocks:
Rocks with many unique shapes, eroded by the waves over millions of years, create an impressive scene."

ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,Clean and beautiful sea
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,The first restaurant the car arrived at had pretty bad food.

ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Blue sea, clean, clean sand, cool water. Wild scenery.
The sea is very beautiful.
There is a free seal circus inside.
Reasonable price.
Should go for a day trip, go in the morning or afternoon and then go out to eat. The restaurant here is simple."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Entrance fee is 170,000. Including swimming, resting, fresh water bathing and watching seal circus. The sea water is clear and very cool despite the hot sun."

ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"The sea water is crystal clear, a beautiful emerald color, no need for swimming goggles but still can see clearly. Fresh air, spacious, beautiful natural scenery"
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,The male ticket seller at the gate is still young but speaks to customers in an uneducated manner. The company should educate and discipline this employee.
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"The sea is beautiful, clear blue, the golden sand is so charming. But the toilet is so smelly and dirty. The seal circus is not special and there is only one seal performing."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,The beach is crystal clear but a bit too crownded in the weekend. The way to get here is a bit challenges but they provide car services when you purchase the ticket.
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,The scenery is beautiful! but the toilets are terrible!
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"The road to the beach is blocked and they charge too much for visiting the beach.
The beach itself is not well maintained, we stepped on glass and cut our foot.
Several large boats were moored near the shore and there was a strong smell of gasoline exhaust and the water was unsuitable for swimming nearby!
If you are planning to go here, I do not recommend it to you, my wife and I regretted it very much"
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Thu, 2/8/2025 5:30 PM
When buying tickets, the staff said the bus would stop at 5:30. Since 5:00, everyone has been waiting to get on, but after waiting for more than half an hour, there were only 2 buses. No staff member directed the passengers to line up, creating a scene where the bus arrived and everyone rushed to get on, it was truly sky-high ticket prices and underground services.
It is not difficult to keep track of the number of passengers entering and exiting to arrange enough buses to pick up and drop off passengers at peak times, but it is impossible to do."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"The beach is beautiful but the service experience is not good. There is no shuttle bus arrangement in the afternoon, making it difficult for guests to get on the bus and dangerous. The staff of the tourist area left earlier than the time informed to the guests, causing service delays and affecting the guests' schedules. Support domestic tourism but the service quality needs to be improved so that visitors can return."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Very nice and clear water, but …
300.000 for the boat
300.000 for a place on the beach, I m alone but the guy force me to paid for 2 transat

20$ for stay between 1pm and 4pm ? … + the taxi it’s very expensive for Vietnam"
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"The beach is nice, but expensive. The service is bad. There are too many tourists. Not chill at all. There are other nice beaches nearby. No need to visit here."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,Clean blue sea
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Ky Co Beach, located in Nhon Ly Commune, Quy Nhon City, Binh Dinh Province, is truly one of the most beautiful beach paradises I have ever set foot on. This morning I had the opportunity to swim here, and the experience was truly memorable with indescribable emotions about a very pristine, pure and peaceful sea. 

From the moment I set foot in Ky Co, I was overwhelmed by the rare natural beauty. The sea here has a clear emerald green color, you can see all the way to the bottom when standing close to the shore. The white sand beach is smooth, clean and stretches in a crescent shape, embracing the calm sea water, creating a peaceful scene like a painting. Even at noon, the sea water still retains a cool, strangely pleasant temperature. The feeling of soaking in the cool water, amidst the majestic natural scenery, behind the rocky mountains, in front of the immense sea and sky, makes me forget all my fatigue, leaving only pure relaxation. 

A special feature of Ky Co is that the sea is quite shallow, very safe for both adults and children to swim. The waves are gentle, not too strong, so there is no feeling of fear when swimming far from shore. I also took the opportunity to dive to see corals near shallow water areas - without too much technique, I can still see colorful coral reefs and schools of small fish swimming around. 

In addition to swimming, this place also has many extremely ""photogenic"" photo angles with natural rocky reefs, wooden bridges close to the sea, or small, pretty thatched roofs on the shore. The air in Ky Co is also fresh, no dust, no noise. Even though there are tourists, everything is still kept quiet and clean, rarely. The locals are friendly, always ready to guide visitors with the hospitality typical of the Central coastal region. 

Swimming in Ky Co is not only a recreational activity but also a healing experience - helping me reconnect with nature, with myself. If you are looking for a place to ""escape"" from the hustle and bustle of life, Ky Co is an option not to be missed."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"The sea is so clear that there is no trash, the seals are great."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"It's really beautiful, incredibly beautiful, next time I will come and swim in the sea to my heart's content."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"The sea is as beautiful as jade, clear as can be seen.

The scenery is majestic, sometimes extremely poetic.

Absolutely beautiful 😍"
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"beautiful beach, clean, many services, the day we went the waves were a bit big so we were a bit scared to go by canoe, the whole family got seasick haha"
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Ky Co Beach is one of the outstanding destinations in Quy Nhon. The sea water is clear, clean and you can see the bottom, the sand is fine white, the air is fresh. The scenery is still quite wild, the nature is almost intact, very suitable for swimming, relaxing or taking virtual photos. The way to Ky Co is now easier than before, often combining electric cars and canoes depending on the service package. However, the ticket price to this tourist area is currently quite high compared to the general level, especially if you go with a large family, it will be a bit ""painful for the wallet"". In addition, some ancillary services such as eating and drinking or renting tents and huts are also quite expensive, so you need to prepare in advance or ask clearly about the cost. However, with such impressive natural beauty, it is still worth visiting at least once."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,The sea is so beautiful. The sun and wind here are really strong. There is a seal circus.
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,The sea is so beautiful
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,Beautiful beach.
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"I just visited Ky Co beach (Quy Nhon) and I have to say: this place is truly a precious gem in the middle of Vietnam's sea and sky. 

What impressed me the most was the crystal clear, emerald green sea water, you can see all the way to the bottom even when standing at the edge of the shore. 

The feeling of soaking in that water - cool, clean and pleasant - is an unforgettable experience."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Business is very messy, tourists traveling together have to wait a long time for the bus to go home."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"The beauty of the beach is honestly nothing special, a little better than the city beach but have to go far. Beheading service.

Very crowded, big waves, those who like to jump waves are OK.

If anyone likes to swim quietly, not crowded, just swim at Nhon Ly beach (where the canoes pick up guests to go to Ky Co). Clean, quiet, public beach

If you have been to Thailand, the Philippines or even Phu Quoc, Ky Co is very normal. Corals are out of the question, because there is nothing to say 😂"
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,Beautiful but too little investment
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Very beautiful, blue water, I went in the summer so it was a bit crowded"
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"We recommend that Ky Co tourist area open from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM, allowing visitors to watch the sunset and sunrise - the two most beautiful times of the day. It opens at 7:00 AM, but in the summer, the sun is scorching hot at 8:00 AM, so how can visitors enjoy themselves? The management of the tourist area does not want to look far ahead, the style is like an autonomous zone, not friendly at all! 

The staff and security guards are rude, not smiling, indifferent like robots, not trained to be suitable for the tourism industry. 

We respectfully propose that Ky Co tourist area adjust its operating hours to open from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM, allowing visitors to experience both sunrise and sunset - the most beautiful moments of the day. 

Currently, the site opens at 7:00 AM, but during summer months, the sun becomes scorching by 8:00 AM, making it uncomfortable for tourists to enjoy outdoor activities. This lack of flexibility reflects poor foresight from the management. The overall approach feels more like an isolated zone than a welcoming tourist destination.

Moreover, the attitude of staff and security personnel is noticeably unwelcoming. There are no smiles, no hospitality – only robotic, indifferent behavior. This clearly reflects a lack of proper training for the tourism industry and leaves a negative impression on guests.

If Ky Co wishes to elevate its reputation and attract more responsible and appreciative travelers, it’s essential to start by treating guests with respect and kindness – not like a burden."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Entrance fee + bus 170,000 dong. It's so far from the ticket booth to the bus stop that you can't walk!! You must take a motorcycle or taxi!! A sunbed costs 300,000 dong for 2 people. No changing room, no shower

300,000 dong by Grab from downtown"
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"A wonderful beach in QN, clean, smooth sand, clear water, beautiful scenery. If you go by road, Ky Co tourist area has enough restaurant services, fresh water bathrooms, everything is good quality and clean."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,Love the Ky Co Eo Gio experience!
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"My family went up by road, parked at the restaurant, and took the electric car down to the beach. The beach has clean sand and clear water. You can see the fish. The kids love it. A must-visit place when visiting Quy Nhon."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Extremely overrated. We had to pay 340.000 VND for entry, 10.000 VND for parking, only to find out that you have to pay 300.000 VND for the beach chairs🤣
The beach is pretty but I’ve seen prettier. Definitely not “Maldives of Vietnam.”
Lot of people, very windy, lot of unnecessary and worn out kitsch decoration. And then , if you want to leave, you have to wait extremly long in the queue for the minibus back, as it is the only option to access the beach."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,Worth exploring
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Riding a motorbike is extremely easy and an experience not to be missed!! The road to Ky Co beach is by motorbike.

I only rented an Airblade, nothing more, the road is only 5km from the tourist area gate to the shuttle bus station. The road goes through the mountain but the tourist area has poured large, wide, beautiful, flat concrete, no difficult bends.
The road goes over the top of the mountain to look down at the whole view of Nhon Ly commune, Bac beach, Eo Gio and along the very long beach to Phu Cat. There are also some straight corners with a super charming view of the wind power plant.

The pass road only has one last section down to Ky Co beach which is difficult, so I took the shuttle bus, no need to think about anything.

Note that the shuttle bus and the tourist area close at 17:30, so come back before that to have a bus back.

Those of you who have already ridden a motorbike from Quy Nhon City to Nhon Ly/Ky Co, just go all the way. At the tourist area gate, there are many canoe tour agents, the tour to Ky Co by sea is also an ok experience, but don't listen to them saying that the road is difficult to travel (I also met someone who ran out and said the same thing). In addition, if you go by yourself, you can stay at Ky Co beach as long as you want, but in my opinion, you should stay here for 2-3 hours because taking pictures and swimming are both endless."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"Crystal clear water, swimming with fish! Amazing!"
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"The sea in Ky Co is needless to say, extremely clear, known as the Maldives of Vietnam hehehe. 

The first time I came here was 2023, I don't remember what day it was. In 2025, when I came back, it was on Sunday. The island was very crowded. Much more crowded than when I went 2 years ago. I don't know if it's because I went on a holiday this year so it was crowded, but 2 years ago I went on a weekday so it was less crowded. Or maybe Ky Co is developing tourism more than before. I'm happy for Quy Nhon because it seems that tourism here has developed more than when I went 2 years ago, but at the same time, I'm also quite selfish because I don't want too many people to know about it because I'm afraid it will be too commercialized and lose its current beauty. 

When you come here, you can swim, play banana boat, canoe, parachute, dive to see coral (but you have to take a canoe about a distance from Ky Co). In general, there are quite a variety of games. The price for parasailing is 700k/person for a parasailing for 2 people and the banana boat is about 250k/person for a boat of 5 people. 

On Ky Co, there are a few check-in spots where you can take pictures such as the white guitar, net, swing, etc. The island has a place to change clothes and shower. The sea water on the island is very beautiful, if you have time, you can come and experience it."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"I just went back on July 9. The place to watch the coral reef is full of floating coconut trash. The bathing place at Ky Co beach for rent, although the flight time is stated to be 10 minutes, it is actually only 5 minutes. The fly camera rental for 400k is so bad that you can't see the nose. In general, everyone using the service should consider carefully."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"The beach is clean and beautiful. I almost never see any trash. The road is easy to go, the scenery is beautiful."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"You shouldn't use services like pikachu or paragliding. They cheat customers. My family signed a contract for 1,450k for one trip. At first, they said they would wait for a big boat to pull the family. When they got the jet ski that could carry 1 person, because the engine was weak, they dragged the whole family in the midday sun and pulled them slowly like a basket boat. Then they let them drift on the sea for 5 minutes and pulled them in. The tour guide also said that they had a monopoly so they cheated customers. Paragliding increased from 900k for one trip to 1.8 million. I've never been on a trip and seen a place that cheated customers like this. I'll be anti-Ki Co until the end of my life."
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"bad, spent 300k to go and didn't see anything worth the money, crowded, worse than Vung Tau, the sea is public but it's been taken over and money is collected"
ChIJKS5LtPNpbzERxwIGzquv6XU,"So beautiful. The sea water is like jade. Cool, clean, friendly."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Located in Nhon Ly commune, about 20km from Quy Nhon city center, Eo Gio is a special arc-shaped strait embraced by two high rocky mountains and always ""sucking in strong winds"" - that is also the origin of the name. 

What makes Eo Gio attractive is the clear blue sea water and steep cliffs that give a wild, majestic feeling. 

The cliff-side walking path with white-red railings is a ""hot"" check-in corner loved by many tourists. 

The best time is from March to September, when the weather is sunny, the sea is beautiful, the wind is light, ensuring better photos and experiences. 

Small notes when you visit: 

Although beautiful, Eo Gio is not a beach with large, smooth sand for swimming and playing comfortably like some other places - mainly for sightseeing, taking pictures and relaxing. 

The road has steep sections or close to the cliff, so wear flat shoes, be careful when it rains because it can be slippery.

Prepare a hat, sunglasses, sunscreen because the sun is strong at noon; and if you go in the afternoon to watch the sunset, you should bring a light jacket because the sea breeze can be a bit cold. 

In short: If you want a natural experience that is both wild and beautiful, Eo Gio is a great choice - spending a few hours here in the afternoon until sunset will be very memorable."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"April 2025
Some nice clean water to the south, beautiful views from the cliff tops."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"There are quite a few places like this in Korea, so it's not quite as impressive. And it's small. There's no shade, so there's no place to rest. I saw a review saying there was an admission fee, but I didn't see a ticket office."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Natural, wild scenery suitable for nature lovers"

ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"We didn't like it at all. It's a rocky beach with a landscaped walking area. The walks take 5 minutes. It's unclear why they charge money for it; it's just rocks with water crashing against them. Swimming isn't possible there. Entry was 20,000 rubles per person, plus 10,000 rubles for parking a bike. Just look at the photos; there's not much point in going there."

Work with Vinhomes & Masterise Homes products, high-class customers. Attractive income, professional environment, close-knit teammates. Comprehensive skills training, rapid promotion opportunities."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"This is one of the tourist destinations you should visit when coming to Binh Dinh. The tourist area has a spacious parking lot, visitors can drive straight to the main parking lot and park for free. If you want to support the locals, you can also park at nearby shops, conveniently buy more drinks before visiting. 

The entrance fee is quite cheap, I only paid 22k/person and found it completely reasonable. Inside, visitors will walk on paths built along the mountainside to both walk and admire the sea view. This route is not long, about 200m, some sections are currently fenced off due to landslides. 

Below the cliff are unique rocky beaches. You can follow to explore more points marked on the map, but note that the rocks here have many jagged shapes, and are often wet due to the waves, so they are quite slippery. 

The scenery here is truly impressive: mountains, sea, and cliffs, with a majestic, wild beauty that makes people a bit overwhelmed by the magic of nature."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Today there is no south wind but it is still beautiful, the sun is too sunny"
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,So beautiful
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Hmm this is a tourist area
The entrance fee is 22k, nothing to talk about.
Parking is written as 3k but when collecting money, it is reported as 5k per motorbike but the ticket is still 3k + a wet towel. Consider it selling wet towels for 2k. I don't like this way of doing business. If I say it, it is not true.
The scenery when I went was windy, the sea was rough and the waves were crashing, it was very pleasing to the eyes. The only problem is that the sky was a bit gloomy due to the clouds so the photos were not very bright."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,Entrance ticket 22k. Nothing worth it.
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Windy, windy"
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Question corner: People charge fees to visit natural landscapes, and what is that money for? Every year I come here and see nothing different."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Located in Nhon Ly commune, about 25km from Quy Nhon city center, Ky Co is known as the ""Maldives of Vietnam"" with clear water, fine white sand and rocky outcrops along the shore creating a poetic scene. This place is extremely ideal for swimming, diving to see coral or taking virtual photos amidst the wild and peaceful nature. 
Ky Co beach is under the management of the tourist area of the same name, the entrance fee is 100,000 VND/trip and 40,000 VND/trip for the shuttle bus to the beach. 

Just a few minutes away from Ky Co, Eo Gio Quy Nhon is a prominent destination with a walking path along the mountainside, winding stone steps leading straight to the sea. This place impresses with its natural cliffs that curve around the coast, creating a ""windy waist"" that is both majestic and romantic. 
Eo Gio entrance ticket is only 25,000 VND/turn, you can freely explore and check-in amidst the vast sea and sky. Especially in the afternoon, standing from Eo Gio, you can look far away, admire the whole view of Nhon Ly sea and Phuong Mai peninsula. 

If you depart from any province with the North - South railway passing through, you can choose the train. You can buy tickets to Dieu Tri Station, about 10km from Quy Nhon center. 

This is a safe, comfortable choice and especially allows visitors to enjoy the scenery along the way. However, traveling by train will take quite a long time (About 22-28 hours if traveling from Hanoi and about 8-10 hours if traveling from Ho Chi Minh City)."

ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"It's nice, but I wish they'd kept the natural scenery within the short course... It was hard to see in the hot weather, but that's the only way to see the beautiful scenery. I put my feet in the sea and took a short break. The rocks were incredibly hot."

ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,What a beautiful place!
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Feel free to take virtual photos. An indispensable place when coming to Quy Nhon. Everyone should go around 4pm to avoid the sun, it will be easier to take pictures. In the morning and noon, the sun is too bright, making it difficult to take pictures and very tiring, not having the energy to take pictures."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"So beautiful, should visit when coming to Quy Nhon"
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,Eo Gio is very windy. You should go early in the morning to catch the beautiful sunrise.
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Eo Gio is one of the outstanding tourist destinations in Quy Nhon, Binh Dinh, famous for its wild and majestic beauty. This place makes a strong impression with the winding rocky mountains hugging the sea, forming a unique strait, with white waves all year round. A beautiful, long stretch of rocky beach, with many strange shapes, creating a natural scene as vivid as a painting. 

The terraced road along the mountainside is an ideal check-in spot, both admiring the clear blue sea and feeling the cool sea breeze blowing through. Eo Gio is also an ideal place to watch the sunrise or sunset - the scene of the sun dyeing the entire sky and sea red is truly unforgettable. 

The quiet space, fresh air and pristine beauty of Eo Gio make visitors feel relaxed and comfortable. This place is suitable for those who love nature, want to get away from the noisy city to find the sea. Although it is just a rocky beach, Eo Gio brings a feeling of both strength and romance - a destination not to be missed when coming to Quy Nhon."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Eo Gio is one of the most prominent landmarks in Quy Nhon, famous for its wild, majestic beauty and rare natural scenery. Located about 20 km from the city center, Eo Gio is a strait surrounded by winding rocky mountains, creating a beautiful arc embracing the blue sea. 

The most impressive thing here is the clear water, where you can see the bottom, the waves gently lapping against the cliffs creating a relaxing, cool sound. The mountainside walking path with red fences standing out against the blue sky and sea becomes a check-in spot not to be missed. On sunny days, Eo Gio appears like a vivid picture with distinct contrasting colors: turquoise water, white foam, and gray-brown rocks. 

Eo Gio is especially suitable for those who love nature, quietness and fresh air. However, this area has few tourist services, so you should prepare food and drinks carefully if you travel on your own. 

In short, Eo Gio is an ideal destination for tourists who want to enjoy the pristine natural beauty, relax and capture extremely impressive photos."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,Beautiful Strait

ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"It's beautiful, but too sunny. The road is not convenient. There are many restaurants and places to visit and take pictures around.

This place is famous for its wild, majestic beauty of nature with winding rocky mountains embracing the emerald green sea.

When coming here, visitors can walk on the wooden road close to the cliff, admire the panoramic view of the vast sea and take beautiful pictures. In addition, Eo Gio is also an ideal place for diving to see coral, swimming and relaxing in the fresh nature.

ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Eo Gio is one of the most famous and beautiful tourist destinations in Quy Nhon, known as ""the most beautiful sunrise viewing place in Vietnam"". Located about 20km from the city center, in the Nhon Ly area, Eo Gio possesses a wild beauty with rocky mountains embracing the blue beach, and beautiful winding cliff-side roads. 

The first impression when coming here is the wooden staircase road along the cliff, facing the sea, very famous on social networks with extremely cool ""virtual life"" photos. Looking down from above, the entire immense sea, jagged rocky shores with clear blue water, rhythmic waves, creating a majestic but also very peaceful natural scene. 

In addition to the beautiful scenery, Eo Gio is also suitable for activities such as watching the sunrise, checking in, gentle trekking, taking wedding photos or combining Ky Co tour, diving to see coral. This area is quite well invested: safe paths, clean restrooms, spacious parking lots, tour guides and full tourist support services. 

A small note: the sun is very harsh and the wind is strong at noon, so you should go early in the morning or in the cool afternoon to enjoy the beautiful scenery and feel more comfortable. The entrance ticket is currently about 25,000 VND/person. 

In short, Eo Gio is a destination not to be missed if you love wild nature, want to admire the beauty of Quy Nhon's sea and sky and find some really ""cool"" souvenir photos during the trip."

ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"As a destination of Quy Nhon (Gia Lai) in the Tour and near Ky Co Beach, it is convenient to stop by. In terms of grandeur and uniqueness, it is not as great as Phu Yen (Daklak) rock plate reef."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Located in Ly Luong village, Nhon Ly commune, about 20-25km from Quy Nhon city center, Eo Gio is a strait with the shape of a ""wind-sucking strait"", creating a majestic feeling like a natural paradise ￼. The name ""Eo Gio"" comes from the mountain top area embracing the strait, where the sea breeze continuously blows through like a natural funnel - this is also the reason for the impressive vertical cliffs and rolling waves hitting the shore ￼. 

The path along the cliff is long, paved with clean stones and has red and white handrails to create a lively highlight. This is an ideal path for walking, watching the deep blue sea, and hunting for sunrise or sunset - the most ideal moment when coming here. From above, visitors can see the whole Nhon Ly fishing village, the peaceful fishing port and the net boats in the middle of the ocean ￼. 

Eo Gio also has a rocky beach with large and small rocks, reminiscent of ""dinosaur eggs"" scattered across the beach - a unique check-in spot, very popular with tourists. If you love experiencing the sea, you can participate in snorkeling, fishing or even light surfing. For those who are more adventurous, sandboarding on the nearby sand dunes is not a bad choice. 

Note that you should visit Eo Gio from March to September - the dry season, calm sea and blue sky - the best conditions to fully experience the beauty here ￼. 

Some advice: go early in the morning to avoid the harsh sunlight, limit the crowded rush hour. Don't forget to bring a hat, sunglasses and sunscreen; at the same time, keep clean, do not leave trash - something you will find necessary when the locality is focusing on environmental protection. 

In short, Eo Gio is a destination not to be missed in the Quy Nhon journey - where wild nature meets cool sea breeze, a place to go for both virtual photos and gentle backpacking experiences."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Eo Gio Quy Nhon is very beautiful, suitable for taking pictures. However, sometimes the wind is very strong here, so everyone should pay attention to the weather to choose a suitable day to visit."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,Beautiful landscapes
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"The water is a bit dirty but you can go down and play in the water for a bit to feel more comfortable. There are many beautiful views suitable for those who like to take photos and check in. When moving, everyone should be careful because the rocks are quite slippery."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"According to google maps, you are at the right place. The road is quite wide and empty, easy to travel, the road is also easy to go, park your car with the security guards outside, buy a ticket and go in. The scenery is beautiful but a bit sunny, there are some extremely cute goats."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"📍 Eo Gio – Nhon Ly, Quy Nhon is still one of the most beautiful check-in spots in Binh Dinh, with the scenery of rocky mountains hugging the sea, the wooden road winding along the cliffs is impressive. However, I visited on a rainy afternoon – and this greatly affected the experience. 

The scenery is still beautiful, there is no denying – low clouds, light gray sea, waves crashing against the rocks creating white foam that is very “poetic”. But the rain makes the wooden road slippery, the cold sea wind and fog obscure the distant view. Many sections of the road are quite steep so you have to be careful, especially for the elderly. 

The big minus is the parking area and transportation: it is mandatory to take an electric car or a 16-seat shuttle bus to the tourist area, but the parking lot is quite chaotic, lacking clear instructions. There are no seats or roofs for waiting passengers – a bit inconvenient when it rains or the sun is harsh. 

👉 If you want to have a complete experience, choose a sunny day and go early to avoid the crowd. For me, although the scenery is still worth it, the rainy afternoon makes Eo Gio lose the brilliance that people often praise.

Hopefully in the future, this area will be better organized to match the existing beauty."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"When you come to Quy Nhon, you should visit this place. So beautiful."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Ticket price 20k. Beautiful scenery. Overall, it's worth visiting. But climbing from the rock beach to your feet is like lifting 2 weights 😆"
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"If you go to Quy Nhon, you should visit this place to check in, everyone. Very beautiful, ticket price is only 22k/person (6/2025)"
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,The beach is beautiful but there is too much trash.
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,Haha I went on a day when it was about to rain so I was very drunk.
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,A beautiful and romantic check-in spot with a romantic combination of rocky mountains - rocky cliffs - clear blue sea - bright sunshine and - strong wind blowing in the deep depths.
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Actually, there is nothing beautiful to admire in this Eo Gio area. It is made into a small walking path with a red concrete railing that imitates wood to help you take pictures and live a little virtual life. The parking lot outside is spacious, with a fee (15k/1 car), and there is an entrance ticket (22k/adult)."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,Beautiful but very sunny
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"A Beautiful place for a small hike. We got lucky when we arrived that it just rained a bit so the temperature was quite pleasant. We were able to hike the whole way and explored all the different spots along the way including one that overlooked the temple next door.

The hike was quite easy with a light breeze. Maybe because of the recent rain.

The area is safe and mostly well paved so our group didn’t have any issues with the trail. There was a section at the end close-down due to potential falling rocks.

We didn’t explore the beach area and the Giếng Tiên but the hike seemed not too difficult."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"It's much smaller than I thought. If there are no people, it takes 5 minutes to go all the way and back. I paid almost 300,000 VND for Grab from Quy Nhon and even paid the entrance fee to go in, and it's pretty. But I didn't know it would be this small. It's about the size of a beach on Jeju Island in Korea. After seeing this place, I realized why people say Jeju Island is beautiful. In fact, Jeju Island has many beaches like this. And there's no entrance fee. I wondered if I had paid the most expensive Grab fee during my trip to Vietnam to see this. I was a little disappointed. And there were so many people that I couldn't take pictures or take pictures. I chose this place as a second choice because the reviews for Kiko Beach were so bad, but it's a shame. Overall, Quy Nhon is hard to get to, but there's not much to see or do."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"A beautiful tourist destination in Vietnam. If you go during the grass growing season, it will be more beautiful."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,Great destination to watch the sunrise. Really should not be missed when coming to Quy Nhon. Must go to Eo Gio to watch the sunrise!!
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Coming to Quy Nhon without going to Eo Gio is a mistake. Here the scenery is so beautiful, the large and small towering cliffs blend with the blue waves hitting the shore creating a lively sound. It is called a masterpiece of nature."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Every time I come, it's sunny like it's the right season, and it's noon 🙂, making the sightseeing trip shorter but still enough time to see Eo Gio like a symphony of sea and mountain, very beautiful. All the photos are taken personally so there's nothing to post 🤣"
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"It's a small place that's easy to find; just follow Google Maps. You can park your bike nearby and take a walk around before heading to Eo Gio, a small local hamlet nearby. You will pass by a pagoda."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Eo Gio is a famous place in Quy Nhon. One of the must-see places. 
Located in a prime location, favorable weather, favorable terrain and favorable people. Here you can admire the extremely wonderful natural beauty. 
Check the weather forecast to bring suitable clothes."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"My experience going to Eo Gio is normal, nothing special

Scenery: The scenery here is incredibly beautiful with a very wide view of the sea, going up to the top there is a telescope looking out to the sea. I was very eager to climb up to see but in the end I couldn't see anything because the telescope was very foggy. The sea view is wonderfully clear like the West. Anyone who comes here to take photos and check in will get 10 points
Service: The service here is also normal, nothing outstanding, the shops below are on a tour, up there it's extremely sunny so you have to sit in a hut while waiting for people to take photos. Eat ice cream and drink a glass of water, there's nothing else.
In short, this is mainly a place to check in and take photos, no swimming, no services at all."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"I went to catch the sunrise but was 5 minutes late, the sun had already risen a bit, I felt so sorry, hicccc
Eo Gio is so beautiful, I've been there twice but the wind was so strong I almost fainted and couldn't take pictures :)))))))"
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,All trash
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Eo Gio is hands down one of the most stunning coastal spots in Vietnam! The dramatic cliffs, crystal-clear turquoise waters, and sweeping ocean views left me speechless. Walking along the winding pathways, I felt like I was in a nature paradise—perfect for photography, relaxation, and soaking in the raw beauty of Vietnam’s coastline.

The entrance fee is very reasonable, and the area is well-maintained. Early mornings or late afternoons are the best times to visit to avoid crowds and catch the magical sunrise/sunset. Don’t forget to explore the hidden caves and rock formations—they add an adventurous touch!

Whether you're a nature lover, adventurer, or just looking for a peaceful escape, Eo Gio delivers an unforgettable experience. Highly recommend adding this gem to your Quy Nhon itinerary!

Tip: Wear comfortable shoes for walking and bring water—it can get sunny!

A perfect 5-star experience!"
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Those who travel by themselves to this area should consider because the road here is quite difficult to find if following gg map. 

Eo Gio is quite famous with tourists when traveling in Quy Nhon, but for me, it is not too wide, there are only a few roads to stand and admire the scenery. Standing on any road, there is only one angle of view looking straight out to the sea, so it is not too special. 

If you go on a sunny day, it will be extremely hot because there are few trees and no roof. 

If you go to take virtual photos, I consider this a quite suitable and worth-the-money place. 

In my opinion, there is also a path for people to walk straight down to the sea, but the road is quite steep and if you go down to the sea, there are many small rocks and a shady corner to rest and avoid the heat, but you cannot swim. 

There are some roads in Eo Gio that I see are fenced off but still have no way to go, so I think the level of completion is not high and there is a risk of danger for visitors. I hope FLC will quickly fix it to have the most suitable sightseeing spot for tourists."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"The beach is beautiful but it will be a bit sunny so everyone should bring an umbrella, a hand fan and don't forget to apply sunscreen."

ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"There's rubbish on the beach and in the sea. There's maybe 200m of path to explore. Honestly, it's not really worth it if you're from a country with clean beaches. I still recommended coming out to this area to explore the beach and alleyways of the town though, it's beautiful and very different from other parts of Vietnam."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Eo Gio is located on Phuong Mai peninsula, Nhon Ly, Quy Nhon city, about 20km from the city center.

Entrance fee is 25k
If you want to take pictures, you should go early or late in the afternoon to get beautiful pictures because it is not too sunny and there are not many people.

If you have the opportunity to visit Quy Nhon but do not go to Eo Gio, then the trip is considered to be missing... half of the emotions. Located about 20km from the city center, Eo Gio is a paradise for those who love to travel and love places that are both wild and poetic.

True to its name, the wind here is not just any kind - it blows coolly, blows your hair, even... almost blows your hat off. The winding walking path follows the cliff, overlooking the blue sea, the waves crashing against the rocks sound extremely soothing. The scenery here is like a vivid picture - blue sky, white clouds, clear sea water that can see the bottom, so beautiful it is heartbreaking.

When going to Eo Gio, you must prepare a fully charged camera, a chilled soul and a little bit of ""adventure"". Remember to combine going to Ky Co, swimming in the sea, diving to see the coral and then having a few plates of fresh seafood in the fishing village next door - guaranteed to fill both your stomach and soul.

If you want to have beautiful photos, you should go in the early morning or sunset, it will be cooler and less crowded. Other times, it is very sunny here

Eo Gio does not need advertising, because once you go, you will want to come back."

Going in the cool afternoon is very pleasant, but if you want better photos, you should visit a little early to take advantage of the light. However, this is still a virtual living and relaxing spot worth checking in."

ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"I parked my motorcycle here, and the sign said 3,000 dong, but they charged me 5,000. I asked if it was 3,000, and they brought out some wet wipes and said 5,000. I told them I didn't need them, so they charged me 3,000, lol.
It was 25,000 at the gate.
Well, they're nice people from a fishing village, after all...

As for the scenery...it felt like a coastline that's quite familiar to Japanese people."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,The scenery is very impressive. Next door is a beautiful small fishing village.
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"The wind blew people away. The scenery was beautiful and the way out to take pictures was safe and easy to walk. The ticket price was not too expensive. Be careful of the photographers, they took pictures and printed them themselves and then brought them back to sell to me. It was so annoying. Why did they take my picture and print it out like that? I bought it, which means they took the picture without permission and then printed it out in a big size and asked if they could buy it. The management should review it because foreign tourists don't like this."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,Eo Gio is a famous place of Quy Nhon city. Everywhere here is beautiful to take photos. My wife loves it so much that she makes me tired of taking photos. My husband and I booked a tour so moving around and having fun was very comfortable and the price was also reasonable. I leave the picture here for reference
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"The sea view is very majestic. When I got to Eo Gio, I saw that taking pictures everywhere was beautiful. The road is quite steep, so everyone should wear comfortable shoes and a sun hat. My family went on a tour, so it was very relaxing, no need to calculate much, and the price was reasonable. I'll leave the information here for everyone to refer to."
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,Check in is also nice. Local people are enthusiastic.
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,Ok
ChIJeWuWpjtDbzER-elucDIa5ts,"Eo Gio is an interesting place, the steep cliffs hug the blue coast, the sea breeze blows cool, there is a red painted railing running along the mountainside, you can climb and watch the blue sea waves crashing below."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"Beautiful sea, natural scenery, cool and peaceful"
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,Good
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"Stopped by on the way back from Linh Phong. We didn't have enough time to swim, so we bought a few snacks from a vendor and just looked around. The waves were nice, and it was perfect for sprinting."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"Trung Luong Beach in Quy Nhon is a serene and picturesque coastal spot, perfect for escaping the crowds. The beach features soft golden sand, clear blue water, and gentle waves ideal for swimming and relaxing. Surrounded by lush greenery and fishing villages, it maintains a peaceful, natural charm. Visitors can enjoy fresh seafood from local vendors while taking in the stunning scenery. The beach is also great for photography, especially at sunrise and sunset. Trung Luong Beach is an ideal destination for anyone seeking tranquility, natural beauty, and an authentic coastal experience in Quy Nhon."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,Beautiful peaceful sea
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"Quite far from the center, beautiful scenery and lovely people"
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,Beautiful beach. But terrible service.
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"I haven't had a chance to go to the beach yet, but from afar it looks super crowded.
In the afternoon, people pouring out from the beach are so crowded 😤
Recently, there is a homestay called Nha Ba Com Ma that I really like, but I haven't had a chance to stay for a few days to experience life there."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"Resort with full facilities, sea view suitable for watching sunrise and sunset. 
Has private beach area and freshwater swimming pool. 
Food and drinks are moderate. 
Very suitable for vacationers or visitors."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"The beach is beautiful, but this time I went there it was too concrete."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"Saw the warning about the danger of whirlpools. The beach is not rough and there are no safety buoys on the beach. Just parked and looked out to sea, they immediately asked to collect 20k. I don't think it's worth it. In general, it's not like everyone said, I'm disappointed with this beach area."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"In Trung Luong - Cat Tien beach area, early morning is when the fishing village wakes up, and that is one of the most rustic, lively and ""eye-pleasing"" scenes when going to the pristine sea.

⸻

🐟 Morning fish selling scene - what's interesting?

1. Bustling time
• From about 5:00 to 7:00 a.m., fishermen's boats begin to dock.

• They bring their fishing nets close to shore, including anchovies, herring, small crabs, squid, mackerel, silver pomfret, small grouper...
• On the shore, women are waiting, taking the opportunity to choose beautiful products to resell at the district market or use at home.

2. Simple, lively atmosphere
• You can hear people calling each other:
- ""Fresh squid, just pulled in!""
- ""The crabs are very strong today, hurry up and grab them!""
• The seller's hands were still covered in sand, her skirt was loosely wrapped, her eyes were bright because she had caught a big catch of fish."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,Sorry for the 50k ticket and 10k parking fee. I went with 3 people and I have to say that there was nothing here. I came back here to play because before the renovation it was quite beautiful and worth the ticket price. Anyone who wants to go should think carefully because there's nothing else they can do besides swimming in the sea. But taking a bath like that is better than going to a residential area where both the fresh water bath and parking fee are 10k. And the beach is the same.
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"The road to the beach is a small alley, so traveling by car is a pain"
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"Trung Luong beach is beautiful, go to the fish market in the morning.
Trung Luong beach is a bit littered, dirty, need to fix if you don't want to lose tourists.
The beach is beautiful in the early morning
The small homestays here are fully equipped but the price is a bit expensive. The people are gentle and pleasant
There are many places to catch small snails, small fish, swim, suitable for children and families.
Seafood here is cheaper than other places. There are many beautiful rocky beaches and corals, the minus point is the litter on the sand."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"I had a trip to Quy Nhon with my family and Trung Luong beach was also one of the destinations my family visited. My family went there on a hot sunny afternoon, a Central region sun. The road was easy to go, but the beach was normal and not impressive enough for me."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"is a beautiful and clean place, with small coral reefs, I hope that everyone comes here to enjoy the beautiful scenery, bathe in the cool water, not to litter, everyone who travels comes and goes, just leave footprints."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"The beach with crystal clear water is extremely beautiful, but the way down is a bit tiring. The tourist area has a BBQ camping site and a cafe and restaurant area to sit and rest and enjoy the sea view. My husband and I booked a tour so we were very comfortable moving around and the price was reasonable too. I'll leave the picture here for everyone to refer to."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"A pristine beach with gentle, tranquil waves."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"Trung Luong beach is beautiful, however there are not many services. It would be more fun if there were more games."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,The sea in 2011 was still pristine and clean.
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,I find it funny but there is one thing that is too imaginative.
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"2 days 1 night trip from Quy Nhon. Grilled seafood at night, chilled campfire on the beach, woke up early to watch the peaceful sunrise, and immersed in the clear blue water. Highly recommend."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"The beach is long, wide, beautiful, and less steep than Qui Nhon beach."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,Beautiful cheap service
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,Pretty
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,The beach is clean and gentle. Everyone should wake up early to watch the sunrise.
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"The location here is very beautiful, many foreign tourists come to the beach to experience, rich, very comfortable space, for tourists to come to bathe and admire the natural scenery, everyone goes in large groups, takes many beautiful pictures 🥰, I have gone many times, feel very satisfied when coming to Trung Luong beach, next time I have the chance I will come back 🥰"
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,This beach is quite far from the center but is worth a try when coming to Binh Dinh. This area concentrates quite a lot of homestays. The sea here is still quite wild. Environmental quality should be improved.
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"I think Trung Luong Cat Tien beach in Binh Dinh is supposed to be beautiful, although during Tet I went the sea was rough but the water was still clear, the fairy rock beach near the resort has green moss for beautiful pictures.

But the sandy beach outside the resort area has trash and many pieces of broken glass, anyone who doesn't pay attention will be lost. On the slope behind the local houses are ""garbage mountains"" like in the clip. I also filmed and took pictures and uploaded them to the review on Google map, the location ""Cat Tien Beach...""
That trash is mainly left by local people, not tourists."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,beautiful
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,Beautiful local beach.
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"A picnic and entertainment area, you can camp here for a fee. The beach is not too impressive."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"This is my first time in Quy Nhon but I chose to stay here. Trung Luong beach has few people but is still safe, the sea is gentle, the waves are gentle, clean and clear, the sand is fine, more beautiful than the beaches in Da Nang or Nha Trang that I have been to."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"The landscape is quite good, it changes a bit every year, I hope it will develop more, just going down to watch the sea or swim is not interesting anymore because there is a great sandy beach next to it, mainly come here to take selfies 😉"
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,Nvien wa attitude
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,Good
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,Beautiful beach.
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"I hope to have the opportunity to come and experience it for the first time, so I give it 5***."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,It is a beautiful place to travel. You can take some great photo.
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,An Afternoon on My Beautiful Beach - Trung Luong
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,There is too much trash on the beach. Can the local authorities send someone to clean up the trash?
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,XII
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"There is only trash, not as sparkling as in the picture, everyone. There is a resort that is beautiful but very sunny. You should not go there."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"I am a beach lover, recently on August 30, 2023 after going to Thich Ca Phat Dai Pagoda, I went down to the beach to try swimming. It was great, the sand was fine, the water was very clear. The afternoon at 5:00 p.m. was very busy, the sea storm was long so I could swim freely. Stop by to park your car and take a fresh water bath at Vuon Tra shop, everyone, the staff will watch your car and belongings carefully, fresh water bath is comfortable! Price is only 12k"

This area is still building small bungalow-style houses, there is a roadside restaurant selling drinks, quite expensive, mainly selling views.
When you want to go down to the beach, you need to buy a ticket, 45k/person.
The bathing area is not very wide, there are many large rocks on the shore. The sea water is blue, the beach is quite gentle and quite cold."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,The sea is beautiful and poetic.

ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"The beach is clean, there are many beautiful photo spots, elderly people or people with weak health cannot go here because they have to climb steep slopes!"

ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"Has a private beach, clean and beautiful view.

The main road outside is beautifully built and wide.
Recently there have not been many convenient services. If you come for the natural seascape and the unexploited beach, then 5*."

ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,Tired but cool
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"This is the first time I have visited Trung Luong beach. The beach is as clean and beautiful as Quy Nhon. If you are far away and do not have the opportunity to go to Quy Nhon, you can go to Phu Cat to play, which is also very beautiful and virtual. Especially near Ong Nui Pagoda, it is extremely beautiful. If you go, you should go to both places. Ong Nui Pagoda has places to eat and rest."
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"I went down to Trung Luong beach, the sea is clean enough to swim. People often bring food out to eat and drink, but they should keep the beach clean to make it beautiful. The beach is near Ong Nui pagoda, looking far away you can see Nhon Ly wind power station. Now people are in the process of building the entire campus of Ong Nui pagoda and building a resort nearby, the roads are more beautiful than in 2017"
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"Very beautiful, clear blue sea, long sandy beach."

ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,Top
ChIJseZSMS9BbzERaTo6pmTy2G0,"Entrance fee is 40k/person. Walking down to the beach is quite tiring (the most terrible part is going back up). The beach is clean, clear, there are 3 tents and 6 chairs on the beach to sit."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,More and more beautiful and neat
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,A diverse marine life space to learn and explore. Also a place for children to have real-life experiences and develop their ability to observe and approach nature.
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"A beautiful, atmospheric and educational place"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,I can't believe there are so many species of fish and other animals in Vietnam. It's very enlightening.
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Institute of Oceanography or Museum of Oceanography are both names of this place.
🌿 Space: the museum is divided into many areas such as model displays, crocodile areas, marine creatures, mini aquariums and images. In addition, one side is the harbor where you can see the beautiful Vinpearl area.
- Plus points: there are precious marine creatures although not too many, cheap tickets, large parking lot, cool sightseeing area. Children love it.
- Minus points: there is an area under repair so it is not very clean.
🌿 Price: 40k/ticket, children free"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,The experience was really enjoyable and wonderful.
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"It is quite interesting, anyone who comes to Nha Trang can consider adding this place to their itinerary. Although it is quite degraded, there are still many things to see, visit and experience."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,Diverse species but there is no air conditioning so it's a bit hot. Ticket price is also cheap. Should experience it.
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,I had a great time there.
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Some nice displays, the shark tank seemed like it needed a good clean and deeper tank.

They need a sign in Russian for the turtle exhibition and more staff to look over them as everyone kept touching the turtles 😞

Like everyone else saying this place doesn't care for the animals they are just for tourism."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Tickets are 40 for adults and 20 for children. We visited this aquarium during rain and bad weather. It's clear the staff is working hard; as far as I understand, the place is constantly being updated and renovated. There's a refreshment stand on site. The restrooms are clean.
The aquarium has several locations, including a shark pool, an outdoor pool with large turtles, and a three-story museum with an extensive collection of all kinds of marine life. There's also a small, beautiful domed aquarium; it's not crowded on a weekday. It's a great place to explore and enjoy some fun in Nha Trang."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Nha Trang, a beautiful coastal city, not only attracts tourists with its smooth white sand beaches and emerald-green waters, but also with its unique cultural, historical and scientific values. During my journey to explore the city, there was a destination that left a deep and unforgettable impression on me, a place where the door to the vast ocean world opened up, full of life and wonder - that is the Nha Trang Institute of Oceanography. 

Located on a large plot of land at No. 1 Cau Da, not far from the city center, the Institute of Oceanography appears with an ancient appearance, bearing the imprint of French architecture since its early days of establishment in 1922. From the moment I stepped through the gate, I felt a completely different atmosphere, a blend of historical nostalgia and the excitement of scientific knowledge. The fresh air, the faint salty taste of the ocean and the murmuring sound of waves from afar were like an attractive invitation.

My journey of discovery began at the large specimen display area. This is probably the place that overwhelms anyone. Before my eyes is a giant humpback whale skeleton, 18 meters long, a great natural creation that has been meticulously and elaborately restored. Standing under that skeleton, I feel so small before the vastness of the ocean and the magic of creation. Just looking at each large vertebra, each long and wide pectoral fin is enough to make my imagination fly far, imagining the image of a gentle giant swimming leisurely in the middle of the ocean. Next to that is the skeleton of a Dugong, also known as a ""mermaid"", with fascinating legendary stories. Each specimen, from rare fish soaked in formalin to collections of corals, shells, and snail shells of all shapes and colors, is a story about the biodiversity of Vietnam's seas. They are no longer inanimate objects, but seem to be whispering about life, the environment, and even lurking dangers.

Leaving the specimen area, I entered a completely different world - the world of vibrant marine creatures swimming around in glass tanks. The aquarium system here is designed extremely scientifically and beautifully, almost perfectly simulating the natural habitat of each species. The mysterious, dim blue light covers the space, the sound of flowing water and colorful schools of fish gliding before my eyes create a scene like in a National Geographic documentary.

I spent hours going from one glass tank to another, not wanting to miss any moment. The playful clownfish, hiding in the soft sea anemones, are reminiscent of the familiar animated film ""Finding Nemo"". The lionfish with their fins spread out like feather fans, move gracefully and gracefully. Or the schools of dragon fish, queen fish sparkling as if plated in gold, plated in silver, swimming in schools creating a mesmerizing dance. In particular, the area of ​​fierce fish such as sharks and rays always attracts the attention of many tourists. Looking at the black-fin sharks with sharp eyes circling behind the thick glass, I couldn't help but shiver a little but also extremely excited. It was a feeling of approaching the ""lord of the ocean"" at an incredibly safe distance. 

One of the highlights that cannot be missed is the glass aquarium tunnel, although not too long but enough to bring a realistic experience. Entering the tunnel, I felt like I was immersed in the ocean. Sharks, rays and countless other fish swam right above and around me. The sunlight through the water created sparkling, magical streaks of light. The moment a giant stingray slowly glided right above, with its characteristic friendly ""smile"", made me and everyone around me gasp with delight. The feeling of being surrounded by the water world, seeing the life under the sea from a completely new perspective was an unforgettable experience."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"A local tourist attraction rarely seen by Koreans. It's not fancy, but it's worth a visit for about 30 minutes or an hour for the 2,000 won admission fee."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,The babies love it
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,Tickets are extremely cheap. Facilities are a bit old.
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"The Nha Trang Institute of Oceanography is very interesting, displaying a variety of marine life, from small fish to rare creatures. The campus is large, with a live aquarium, suitable for the whole family and those who love marine research."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"I've heard about this place for a long time, just went today
The ticket is 40 50 or so, equal to a glass of gong cha
In general, I think it's okay, nothing special, maybe because I've been to Vinpearl's aquarium many times, so I don't think it's special
On Sundays, there are many couples and families bringing their children to play, it's not too crowded
But it's clean and doesn't look old, so it's probably ok"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"The Institute of Oceanography was established on September 14, 1922 during the French colonial period with the original name of the Indochina Fisheries Oceanographic Service (Service océanographique des pêches de l'Indochine). When talking about the Institute of Oceanography, one cannot help but mention an organic part of it, the Oceanographic Museum - which has been very famous since the 30s of the last century with the popular name ""Nha Trang Oceanographic Institute Aquarium"". Currently, the Oceanographic Museum is focusing on investing in upgrading, expanding and developing into a complete complex including marine aquariums for research, sightseeing as well as community education, and the largest marine biological specimen storage system in the country. Many specimens have been sent to many different laboratories abroad and many museums around the world."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"We loved it. For the ridiculous price of 40,000 dong per adult, we spent about half an hour walking around and looking at both living and formalin-preserved exhibits. There are several beautiful photo spots."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,Should come when coming to Nha Trang
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"The place stores many specimens as well as living individuals, for those who are passionate about the environment living under the ocean because of the valuable documents about animals and plants that are rarely seen normally, but the scale of the tourist area is not too large, just visit a little bit and it's all over."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

The Nha Trang Institute of Oceanography is a destination that is both scientifically valuable and a cultural experience worth visiting. 🌊

Founded by the French in 1922 as the Institut Océanographique de l’Indochine (Institute of Oceanography of Indochina), this is the oldest marine research facility in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. After more than a century, the Institute still plays an important role in researching, preserving and displaying marine species.

Currently, the Institute's museum has more than 20,000 specimens and many living creatures, of which the most impressive is a giant whale skeleton nearly 18 meters long. The visiting space is clean, full of useful information, both educational and very interesting for tourists.

👉 If you have the opportunity to come to Nha Trang, I really recommend everyone to visit the Institute of Oceanography to learn more about the ocean and have a different experience compared to familiar tourist attractions."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"I went with a group so I didn't take many pictures
But after the visit, I learned a lot about the ocean and saw many species that have existed and are still living under the sea
The beauty of marine life and the mystery are fully arranged
2025 × entrance ticket 40k 1 person"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"A very suitable place for children, children will learn many interesting and useful things here."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"At first, I thought the Oceanographic Institute was like an aquarium, but it's not. It's more like an oceanographic museum because in addition to the large fish tank, there are many models and skeletons of fish and marine creatures. When I went to see it, I was also wowed by the many types of super large marine creatures. Going from one area to another. There are many aquariums and then the last one is a large aquarium like an aquarium. Very beautiful and interesting, suitable for children to visit. The downside is that it's super hot here, there's no air conditioning and it's very crowded, so children have to be careful about their health. I went at the end of August, but it was very hot. After visiting all the sights, there was no separate exit, so I had to go back to the original entrance in the tunnel, so the inner area was crowded and hot with people coming and going."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,Worth coming
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Come see the 6 6 fish, it's also fun"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"It's so hot. No fan. Lots of cans. It's like an underwater tunnel.
I can't even see it."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,great place for children to learn
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Diverse marine life
Good display, eye-catching
It's quite hot if you go at noon because there is no air conditioning.
The arrangement of the direction is quite inconvenient, there is only one way in and out. If you want to go out, you have to go in the opposite direction."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,So beautiful
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,Anyone who goes to Nha Trang cannot miss this
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"The tour price I went with was only 40k/person, so you should go."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Interesting, space is a bit small for more display"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"The entrance fee to the Institute of Oceanography is relatively cheap. With only 10,000 VND/ticket for students, 20,000 VND for university students and 40,000 VND for adults, visitors can visit and explore the world of marine life and rare specimens."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Everyone who goes to Nha Trang should visit the Institute of Oceanography to learn and see marine life.

It can't be compared to the aquarium at Vin Wonder, but the ticket price of 40k for adults is very cheap."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"I really like Nha Trang Oceanography Institute 🐠. The entrance fee is only 40,000 VND but there are so many interesting things inside: from a miniature aquarium full of colorful fish and corals, to a giant whale skeleton nearly 20m long that overwhelmed me 😮. In addition, there are tens of thousands of unique marine life specimens, both beautiful and scientifically valuable. Not only sightseeing, this place also helps me understand more about the sea and islands and feel proud. If you have the opportunity to come to Nha Trang, this is definitely a place I recommend going, both cheap and useful 👍."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Tickets are only a few dozen, but worth it, everyone."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,100000/10
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Cheap ticket price (40k), plenty of creatures and infographic to see and learn. The aquarium is beautiful, but it can get very crowded during holidays."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Many kinds of saltwater fish. Children love it, cheap price 40k."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,+ Quality is acceptable.
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,The display is quite nice. Worth a visit.
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Clear information, fast service. Cheap tickets.
Interesting places to visit"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,The institute is a bit old but has many unique specimens and creatures.
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Located at the end of Tran Phu Street - Nha Trang, is also a tourist attraction of Nha Trang City."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"I see there are a lot of Russian tourists, I think we can add a description in Russian to attract more tourists."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Nha Trang Institute of Oceanography is one of the leading marine research centers in Southeast Asia and is also an extremely attractive tourist destination in the coastal city of Nha Trang 🌊.

Here are some pictures Beautiful photos from Nha Trang Institute of Oceanography to help you feel more clearly about the ""miniature ocean"" in the heart of the coastal city:"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"The ticket price is so cheap, especially students offer just 20k VND only!! (Remember to bring along student’s card). There is species diversity and the experience is totally fine 🤘"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Many fish are very cute but when passing by the toilet, it smells terrible. It's extremely hot so prepare to bring a hand fan to avoid getting hot in there."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,I came here the first time back in 2014 and it was a nice place to learn about marine life. Now I'm very disappointed. It's sad to see how miserable this place has become. It has basically become a selfie spot with a lot of noise. Very unpleasant experience. Dirty too
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"A place to experience when coming to Nha Trang for the first time, very suitable for taking virtual photos and visiting unknown sea creatures. The ticket price is also very reasonable."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,Great place about marine biodiversity. Must go.
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,Diverse fish and marine life. Bringing children or family will also be an interesting place. The ticket price of 40k for adults is reasonable. Large parking lot with enthusiastic and friendly staff.
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Although not as magnificent as the aquarium in Vinpearl, it is quite complete in variety. Should visit when going to Nha Trang. For those who have never experienced it, it will be a memorable memory."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Ticket price is only 40k, students only 10k, children are free, this attraction is really not to be missed. There are many beautiful sea fish, corals, and anemones, neatly arranged, scientifically attractive. Especially the tunnel through the mountain displaying the fish tank. In addition, you should go to the pier, there are corals and many natural fish swimming very beautifully, no need to go far. In addition, there are many chill scenes to take pictures."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Very interesting, everyone should visit. Hopefully there will be more species on display."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Located far from the center, so remember to go early. Ticket price is ok, very cheap for students. However, the price of drinks is expensive, a glass of orange juice is 50k :)))
Many areas, spacious, many types of fish."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Just go once to know but nothing special, there are some rare fish species. The road is very long but at the end you have to go back, there is no exit. The design is confusing."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,Interesting place for children. Ticket price 40k/person 8/2025 easy to access. There is a canteen with a slightly higher price.
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"A famous and worth-visiting attraction in Nha Trang. 🌊🐠
• This is an ideal place to better understand the marine animals in the area, with many rich and interesting displays.

• Reasonable ticket prices, suitable for both families and groups of friends.
• However, it is always crowded even on weekdays, so it is a bit noisy and crowded.
• The entrance is small, there are many vehicles, the entrance area is a bit messy. There is only one entrance/exit, so you have to turn around when exiting.
• In return, inside there are many areas to visit, learn, take pictures and explore.

👉 Overall: A very worth-visiting place when coming to Nha Trang, both educational and an interesting experience."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Adult ticket 40, student 20, student 10, parking 4k
Spacious campus, many marine animals
A beautiful place to take pictures
Quite a lot of visitors"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Going alone is so chill, going around 4 hours or so is cool and fun
I wonder if the girl who filmed the last video for me will come here to watch, if so, thank you very much hehe"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,beautiful and cheap too ok
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Variety of fish and specimens, however facilities appear old and run down."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"A must-see place when traveling to Nha Trang, many beautiful angles and rich marine life"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,Attractive tourist destination in the coastal city of Nha Trang.
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"good, worth experiencing, suitable for all ages"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Should experience when going to Nha Trang, very interesting"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Compared to 10 years ago when I went, the hospital is now much more beautiful and invested in. In general, it is very suitable for those who like marine animals. It is clean and cool. If you have a student card, you should bring it along and get a half-off ticket."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Visiting here takes about 1-2 hours. Adults 40k - students 20k (bring card or app). There is an entrance to Truong Sa park, there is a beach with a view of Vinpearl in the distance. A building is under construction that looks very fancy. See you back in a few years to visit hehe"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,Crowded and super hot😔
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,Worth watching
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"With this ticket price, don't expect too much, but I think the space and creatures are still worth visiting and experiencing. 
An extremely important note is that if possible, DO NOT GO ON SATURDAY or SUNDAY, what you will see is not fish but people. Our group went on Sunday so we only saw people. We took the time to take 1 or 2 pictures. It's always crowded so sometimes it's difficult to catch a bus, so please take note before going. 
Oh, students only need to send electronic information to buy tickets, they don't need to use their student card."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Many creatures, worth experiencing"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,still lingering on the way home
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Visited, felt normal. Too crowded, the entrance fee is also high.
Check in is suitable but the aquarium is a bit dark, difficult to take pictures."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Great,"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"This place is worth going. The aquarium is beautiful, there are many creatures, including sharks, turtles, sea monsters, etc. The specimens range from small to giant, both chill and “wow”. Not crowded, cool to walk, super cheap ticket price."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,Beautiful 💚
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"The Institute of Oceanography is an interesting place to visit for everyone. An attractive tourist destination for many young people, especially children, to gain new perspectives on the marine environment."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"A must-see place when coming to Nha Trang. Ticket prices are clearly listed, I went on Sunday and it was very crowded. There are many areas to visit with countless types of fish (note: do not take photos with flash, everyone)"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Place to go when traveling to Nha Trang. Very suitable for children, cheap tickets and many things to explore. 

Spacious car parking, with fee."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,This year's renovation is quite spacious and complete. Spacious car parking (with 15k).
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,Worth a visit with lots of marine life
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"- The Oceanographic Institute is worth going to
- It's very crowded and quite hot in the summer
- Lots of strange creatures. There are both models and living creatures.
- Takes great pictures."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"beautiful, many good things.
but everyone keep the public hygiene and do not let children step on the glass. The facility looks very degraded, hope everyone together to preserve it for the future"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Crowded, rundown, hot"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"I visited from 3pm to 5pm. The institute has many species of marine life and detailed information boards, very suitable for those who like me to watch and read at the same time. Especially, there are turtles and hawksbill turtles in the Vietnam Red Book. Hopefully there will be a pair of turtles laying eggs, it would be great. Currently, the facilities are limited, for example, the turtle pond and shark pond are very small. Hopefully, the institute will have more funds to upgrade this part in the future."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"The impressive point is the Marine Biology Museum - which stores more than 24,000 specimens of over 4,000 rare marine species, from fish, corals to crustaceans, with many rare and large specimens such as sharks, whales, giant groupers carefully preserved. In addition, the Living Exhibition Area with glass tanks raising many marine species in a simulated environment helps visitors to directly observe the colorful and rich ocean life."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Amazing, diverse marine life"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Diversity of marine life
Ticket price 40k"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,There are many marine creatures but mainly specimens. Ticket price is 40k/person. It is quite crowded on weekends. There have been many changes after 5 years of returning.
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"The place I want to go to most in Nha Trang.... Finally arrived, the specimen exhibition area has a lot of specimens!!! Entrance fee is 40k, with student ID card it is reduced to 20k."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"• Advantages:
- cool, in addition to the exhibition area, the section next to TS park is super spacious, clean, cool, and has a great view of Vinpearl
- The landscape is also good, beautiful, cool, clean and green, with many fans so it's not too hot
- There are many fish 🐳🐳🌊🌊
• Disliked points:
- CROWDED because it's too hot, everyone who comes to NT wants to try it out, going on a Tuesday in the middle of the week is super crowded, so crowded that it's hard to find a corner to stand and take pictures, and the area to see the fish is also small, narrow, dark, and full of children 😭
- Many places are a bit old, dark, and don't feel very clean, there's not much on display, the fish are tiny

=>>> just go to see, there's nothing special to come back 💞💞"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,A bit old but provides a lot of useful information about nature and the sea.
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Good service, friendly, food comes out fast."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Good, but the turtle pond is not good, turtles are rare animals but the pond is not cleaned, some turtles even eat dry leaves, that directly affects the turtles' health, I rate this very low, I hope the Institute of Oceanography will consider this."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,A place to keep ocean collection in Nha Trang
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Large space, many marine creatures, especially fish
I think this place is more suitable for children. There are many interesting marine creatures to visit. Personally, I think it's okay to go just to see. I went at noon so it was quite crowded
Ticket price 40k/adult"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,Children love it
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"so awesome everyone!!! Come here to explore and learn and also see beautiful fish, marine life and other super cool things. Very suitable for taking children to learn. A wonderful experience worth trying when visiting Nha Trang!!"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,Very good for children
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"crowded because of many tour groups, hot so a bit stuffy, people who like to take pictures, watch fish can go
there are some cute fish

tip when you want to go: bring a fan
go deep inside to take beautiful videos"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,Sightseeing and suitable for students. Special price for students and seniors.
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Ticket price is too cheap 👍
Large campus, many areas to visit
A place worth experiencing
Suitable for children"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"When you go to Nha Trang, you can't miss the Institute of Oceanography. 

- Tickets: 40k/adult; 20k for students; 10k for students. (Students need a card, students don't need one) 

- Many tourists, there are signs showing the way to visit, there are many species of marine animals and many photo spots (so there are traffic jams). 

- The aquarium has cool wind, but it smells a bit. 

- There are 3 floors to visit (the 2nd floor on top stores animals, there are chemicals that cannot be touched) 

NOTE: DO NOT TAKE FLASH PHOTOS, when I went, some people turned on the flash to take pictures (it's harmful to the fish) 

=> After visiting, you will have more knowledge about marine animals and many beautiful photos."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Some valuable and interesting photo angles, conveniently located next to Vinpearl Land"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Too crowded for one trip. We jostled each other little by little, went half way and then left."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Too crowded.
No one to control the number of people coming in and out.
The corridor smells of urine…. Too stuffy, smelly, dirty….
The youth project is shabby and not taken care of.
Lack of light
Don't go on Sunday mornings"
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"The Institute of Oceanography is located in a historical monument: the summer residence of the last emperor of Vietnam - Bao Dai. Not a large fish exhibit, there are turtles and sharks. You can see everything in 30-40 minutes if you are not in a hurry. A separate hall is dedicated to the history of fishing. There is no wow effect, but overall the child liked it."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,There are many types of sea creatures that we rarely see alive.
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"I’ve visited this place a couple of times and still enjoy stopping by whenever I go to Nha Trang. 3–4 years ago, it was a little quiet, but now it’s more crowded. More and more young people come here to take photos. I really love the shores near the mangrove forest — it’s so cool

Every time I go to Nha Trang, I go to Vhd as a habit. Tickets are cheap, close to the center. This time the hospital looks newer but is also much more crowded than the last time I went. But it is still a place worth visiting."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,"Cheap tickets, lots of marine life, but some areas are quite hot because there is no air conditioning."
ChIJa_Rl9KBncDERMzuN8X6AXpA,There are many beautiful pictures when you are away.
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Very good experience when staying on the island for 1 night
Most groups only visit during the day, our team stayed overnight so it was very quiet, eating BBQ on the sand next to the sea
The island is beautiful, you can see the sunrise or sunset
The island is still quite wild, tourism is only exploited on one side while the other side of the island is still inhabited, it feels quite close and friendly
Good service and quite convenient"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,The water in the sandy road appears in the middle of the sea very beautiful
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Round-trip ticket price to the island at Van Gia port is 300k/person
The boat will take you to the island of the reclining Buddha to check in the sea route of 2 ocean currents (I think so)
The rice will be pre-cooked, additional food (sour soup) is 500k/kg of fish or fried meat with burnt edges.
Milk oysters 10k/each
Around 10am, the water gradually recedes, revealing a long coral reef, connecting the 2 islands. The sea water is clear and there are many anchovies"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"The tourist area is not invested in, renovated, and seriously degraded. Like this, no one wants to travel to the island. Too bad. I want to curse but I can't 😂😂😂."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"The beach is beautiful, interesting and there is food service on the island. The highlight of the island is the strip of land connecting the two islands, it feels like walking in the middle of the sea. Otherwise, there is nothing special."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"There is no negative point, but if there is, it is given. Taking advantage of visitors from far away who are not familiar with the area, charging 600k per visitor, they only take the canoe to two small islands, Hon O and Hon Qua, but do not take the largest and most beautiful Hon Bip. On top of that, no one guides when arriving at the island, leaving visitors to find their own way there. When they arrive, there are only a few broken huts. There is no beach, only rocks. The tables and chairs are shabby, and they raise a pack of dogs running around, which is annoying. The two old people who introduce themselves as the island owners do not show any professionalism but take money as if it is right. Eat it all, those two old people. Old but not well-mannered, the island owner drives the canoe and curses at the visitors without any respect. If you provide such a service, you two should go play with crickets. The cost is funny. The canoe fare was 2.2 million, the food cost 2 million for a table with only 7 plates of food, after eating my family had indigestion, couldn't run to the bathroom in time. The bathroom was also disgusting. No plus points for this trip. I felt sorry for the money and was angry. Such a heartless service!"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Very beautiful
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"I saw that DI CHUNG XE organizes hiking tours here, the price is suitable for everyone, the scenery is beautiful."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"There are 2 very friendly locals here, they let us experience crab catching, snail catching, squid fishing, very fun, the grandparents here are very friendly, play with the children, the grandparents often clean up the trash so it is very clean. Everyone remember to come and support."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"I went to Diep Son Island on the Diep Son - Doc Let tour.
I went on a day affected by the storm so the water was high and I couldn't see the road clearly.
In my opinion, this place is quite... ugly. Trash is everywhere, it is both wild and destroyed by humans.
If you go on a tour, you will have lunch at a local's house. Next to it is another homestay area, they will not let you go to their area (including the port) to take pictures.
If you go, remember to check the weather carefully to have a better experience. 🥲"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Had the opportunity to come on the day of the water receding so I could go on the most beautiful road on the island. 
Due to a storm in 2019, the sand on the road was lost so much so I couldn't go far. 
The island has a very wild landscape, the people are gentle and friendly. Suitable for those who like to explore or like to experience. 
Having a meal on the island cooked by the locals is also quite delicious and close. 
Everyone should visit when they have the chance!"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Great!
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Passionate about
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Absolutely beautiful, just watch the tide so the sand trail is exposed. The only downside is that too much trash flows in, causing pollution and unsightliness."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Take a boat to the island about 20 minutes. The beach is beautiful, the sea is blue and clear. There is also a road in the middle of the sea, but it was destroyed by the storm so only a small section remains."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Outstanding beauty
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"The sea is beautiful, you go to the Van Gia port and ask the locals, they will direct you to the island owner to book a boat ticket to the island. During low season, go on the weekend or call in advance, otherwise there will be no boat to the island, you have to wait for a new group to join."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,The island is still pristine and worth exploring.
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,The nature is fresh and still has its wild beauty.
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Ticket price 700k/adult to go to Diep Son - Doc Let
Island is degraded, lots of trash... quite disappointing"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Very satisfied~~~There are definitely not many places in Vietnam where you can see such beautiful scenery and landscapes 😀
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Beautiful island, you have to ask about the tide to go, 3 small islands, wild, clear water. It can be called a island but not an island."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Beautiful beaches with white sands
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Just passing through, stopped in for lunch on the mainland."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"A very boring experience. Believed the online reviews, determined to experience and received the following special memories:
- No beach.
- No entertainment.
- No water and no electricity.
- The food was terrible, border area but all rotten food.
- The landscape was full of mud and graves."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"The island is beautiful with sand roads connecting the islands. The beach has two sides, one hot and one cold, the water is very hot. However, it is not very enjoyable for swimming because of the strong wind and many pebbles. But it is very beautiful for taking pictures. The restaurant's food is ok. The rooms for rent have air conditioning, which is very convenient."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Rent a canoe to the island or join a group to save money.
The sun is so hot, we arrived at the island at 3pm so the road connecting the two islands is clearly visible, take a few photos to gain experience and then go home, really free.

The scenery is beautiful, for those who like to take photos or couples to take pictures.

But it's tiring, the service is sketchy... just go to show people!"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"The feeling of walking on the road in the middle of the sea is so interesting, the island is small and beautiful."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"The island is so beautiful, you definitely have to come to go on this unique and beautiful road. Very emotional. You go to the port to catch the boat. This area is all leased, so you have to go through the expensive service. Cano 350k/person only includes canoe and the cost to go to the island, if you eat 650k. If you are in Nha Trang, book a tour to go, it will be cheaper than going on your own. The price is about 630k_650k for this tour. Ah. The boat starts at 9-10am. You should go early to join the boat or buy a tour and they will take care of everything for you, that's the best."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Canoe to the island 350k/person. Travel time about 20 minutes. Beautiful island. Clear sea, lots of seaweed. Restaurants on the island are affordable, delicious food. Double room for overnight stay 800k. Arrive at the island before 3pm to see the road in the middle of the sea."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,too ok
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Diep Son Island seen from above.
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Diep Son Island is very beautiful, the roads connecting the islands are only visible and passable when the tide is low, based on my experience, it is around the 15th-19th lunar days of each month and before going, you should consult the tide calendar to see what time the water is lowest."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,IN
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Beautiful, affordable price.
Sincerely."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Diep Son Island consists of 3 small islands, with a special feature of having a white sand road that appears when the water recedes, the water is clear, clean and almost free of trash. Van Gia Port is about 60km from Nha Trang, then rent a boat/canoe to the island for about 30-40 minutes. After having a self-sufficient trip, it is highly recommended that you join a tour to optimize costs and experience. At the pier, there will be a woman selling boat tickets to the island, the price is 250-300k/round trip depending on the time. Because we took a shared boat, we had to depend on and wait quite a long time to get there, when we returned, we got on the boat but it turned out that we were on a boat that the tour had booked (like a type of shared boat). Because we went on our own, the boat only dropped off passengers on an uninhabited island, there were only a few people who came out to provide services: renting jet skis, SUP, kayaking, fresh water showers and food and drink. The ticket to the island will include fresh water showers, drinking water, and free resting huts. There is no fixed menu for food, but they will make fresh seafood dishes caught that day, as shown in the picture above, a portion for 2 people, 300K/person. Compared to eating on the mainland, it seems quite expensive, but coming here, I want to support the people on the island. The snails are very big, the shrimp are fresh, the squid is delicious but the ink sac has not been removed yet, so I have to remove it myself while eating, a bit dirty. 
Around 1-2pm, a boat will come to pick you up and take you back to the mainland. 
If you go on a tour, you will be taken to the third island, which has about 100 households. There will be more services and more options to visit there."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Suggest cleaning the bathroom more...
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Travel from Van Gia pier to Diep Son island, the price for each person is about 200-250k if there are enough people or join with other groups of tourists around 9:30 am and return at 1 pm, or you can rent a private boat with the price from 2.5 million but the time of entry and exit is free. Note for those who have not been there, you should refer to the tide time to be able to take pictures of the white sand road between the islands. In addition, you can stay overnight on the island but the electricity is only available for a few hours each night."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Beautiful scenery, clear blue water and impressive beach walks, but also a lot of trash due to being ""forgotten"" by tourists coming here."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Bring your water shoes.
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"The island lord is very friendly, at night he lets his crew burn 🔥 drag nets of snails, fish and crabs to drink right in the middle of the sea. In the morning, go snail hunting. The food is beyond criticism. 3 days 2 nights with nature"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"I visited the Island many years ago and took some old photos to commemorate.
Updated 2016"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"A wonderful place for camping, relaxing with family and friends, there is diving, mini bungalows, canoe, two trails connecting the islands.

Impressive views, you are taken there by speedboat for 10 minutes.
It is better to visit in the morning. class"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Take the tour bus for nearly 2 hours to get there, beautiful green space, cool breeze. Take a break from the hot sun at noon"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"So beautiful, just need to embellish it in a natural direction and it's ok"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"A cluster of 3 small islands collectively called Diep Son, where there is a walking path between 2 beautiful small islands, clear sea water and white sand, colorful coral, pristine scenery, tourists will love coming here, note that there is only one restaurant on the island, so you should order food before going in a large group."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Impressive island long sandy walking path in the middle of the sea, clear blue water"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Diep Son Island impresses visitors at first sight with its wild and poetic beauty, along with unique virtual living spots such as the one-of-a-kind walking path in the middle of the sea, the love bridge where couples date... Because of that, Diep Son tourism has become a destination that many people tell each other about. Diep Son Island belongs to Van Phong Bay, Khanh Hoa, about 60km from Nha Trang city. It consists of 3 small islands: Hon Bip, Hon Giua, Hon Duoc. The most prominent feature of Diep Son is the nearly 1km long sand road in the middle of the sea, connecting the islands together. Visitors can easily walk from one island to another and take advantage of the opportunity to take more vivid photos in the middle of the immense blue sea."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"A very interesting experience. Very beautiful view, not crowded. There are a lot of fish"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"The beach is beautiful and quite wild, note that when you reach the stop, rent a motorbike for 10k to take you to the beach, if you walk it's very far, it's too hot to go, from the stop to the sandy beach there are rocks and shells, so you can't swim. The food here is mostly fresh but the taste is average, acceptable, not cheap"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Facilities are not yet complete. Suitable for tourists who like to explore.
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Road on the sea, clear water but not suitable for swimming, only suitable for checking in"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,The island is very beautiful. Will go and experience it again.
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"beautiful nature, taking pictures is so beautiful, everyone should go to Van Gia port before 9am, take a 30-minute canoe to get there, have fun on the island until about 2-4pm, the canoe will return, if you arrive at the end of the day, find a hotel in town and wait until the next morning to go to the pier ..................................................................................................."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Dieshan Island, a future star attraction"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,The sea walk is wonderful.
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Wild scenery. Main activities are taking photos and checking in on the sandy road. Need to find out before going to know the time when the road is most exposed.
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Diep Son Island - Van Phong Bay - Khanh Hoa Province is a great place for tourism and exploration, clear sea water, poetic scenery, a rare check-in place in Asia."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,A wild and beautiful island. It is best to contact the island owner in advance to know the tide schedule and to order lunch so you can spend the whole day here.
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,There's better but it's nice to do
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"I drove from Tuy Hoa to Van Gia when it was already noon, there were no more trains. Luckily, my girlfriend called Ms. Long and was able to join the trip with the people of Hon Bip (I got off at Hon O). 
As far as I remember, Hon O was inhabited by only Uncle Dai Anh, which meant that when I arrived, there were only 3 people on the island :3 . It felt like I was on a deserted island. Uncle Dai Anh was very simple and told good stories. Whatever he grew, he offered to tourists. He invested in roads and infrastructure on Hon O. However, probably because there were too many tourists and one person couldn't manage it, the items also deteriorated over time. This is a pity and I also feel sorry for him. 
I had a wonderful experience here. I hope that people who come after will be more conscious of preserving the landscape."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Beauty scene
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Still wild, there are restaurants and coffee shops on the island. Staying overnight will save electricity at night. 
The island is very sunny. The beach has many hard rocks and shells, not suitable for swimming. Mainly for check-in. 
Taking pictures when the water is high will feel like walking on the sea, very beautiful. In the afternoon, when the water is low, you can go to the other island."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,A place to rest and relax. Surrounded by sea. The main entertainment is swimming and kayaking. On the island there is a restaurant and 6 bungalows (no air conditioning). Electricity from the generator should mainly serve lighting. Equipment on the island is very limited (few). Go to the island by canoe of the island owner.
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"There are not many services, the road on the sea only emerges occasionally."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Still quite beautiful but the old road between the 2 islands is gone, unfortunately."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Nha Trang area has many beautiful beaches & islands, some of them popular with visitors. Diep Son Island is more known to locals but as a foreign traveler, here is my experience both good and bad.

Getting to the island is only via speedboat. The jetty at that time was under some kind of upgrading construction, therefore dusty and hard to push your luggage bags through the dirt. Speedboat service has life jackets, but the driver was too fast and when hitting the waves at high speeds, the ride was really bumpy.

As it's a small island, there are limited activities you can do here - probably only swim & kayak. There are a few areas which are nice for those Instagram shots. I'd say, it's more of a relaxed island and you can take this opportunity to disconnect from civilization.

All of the meals are provided by the island operator if you choose to eat here on a day trip or staying overnight. I really love the food as they serve fresh seafood like oysters, snails, lobsters, squid, etc.

The entire island runs on solar power & rainwater. At certain times of the day, power is cut for the solar batteries to recharge. Water for shower is there at the central restaurant or at the chalets. The toilets are basic, don't expect luxury.

If you choose to stay here overnight, I need to prepare you what to expect. The island operator was granted a lease by the government to develop the island and they have done so at their own cost. They have built chalets which run on gasoline generators and at night, power to the lights & fans may be cut. There is no air-conditioning, so you're basically living like how it was before air-conditioning was invented when you get the natural breeze & sounds of the waves.

Diep Son Island has its charms & limitations. I'd say come here with an open mind and soak in the experience without any demanding expectations, you would love to enjoy this place."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Beautiful and wild.
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Just lift the camera and take a picture and it will automatically give you a beautiful photo.
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,The beach is quite clean. Pristine. Good food for lunch. A beautiful spot for check in.
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Disappointed! Dirty, no swimming beach here, few facilities, average food at the island and only attraction is you can walk to another island during low tide."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,peaceful
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,The most beautiful place in Nha Trang for me! 😁 Worth going! 💙
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"I went on an island tour for 680k/person including lunch at a local's house on the island. The island is very beautiful, the water is very clear, and the island still retains its natural beauty. The sandbar connecting the two islands will gradually appear after 12 noon. Those who go to the island should be extremely careful because the sun will be very strong, so bring a hat and sunscreen."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Service
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Rather disappointing. Dirty, no swimming beach here, few facilities, average food at the island and only attraction is you can walk to another island during low tide - better walk knee deep in another place"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Beautiful sea, clear water.
Take a canoe to the island"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,So beautiful
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"I just left on August 1, 2022. Arriving at the Island at 11:00 am, the road between the two islands is not clear yet, it will be clear until around 1:00 pm! Price 350k/person includes canoe to and from!"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,2022/08/02
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Hehe
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Not everyone knows that Diep Son Island Nha Trang is one of the three important Economic Zones of Vietnam!
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Still wild, but there is a very rare sand road connecting the two islands"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"Very beautiful and unique - the road in the middle of the sea, connecting two small islands of Diep Son island. The sea water is crystal clear. When the tide is low, a small road with white sand is revealed. Everyone should refer to the tide time to avoid waiting for a long time. However, the downside is that there is quite a lot of trash around the island and on the road on the sea. If someone picks it up every day, the amount of trash will be very small. The food is quite fresh but expensive."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"The experience of going by canoe to the island was too boring because the island was too wild and there weren't many entertainments. I went to the island because I heard an ad that there was a road across the sea at low tide, but it wasn't available until 6pm, so I had to endure it. It was a waste of time and nothing special."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,The house is quite primitive. The bed is a bit lacking in amenities. But beautiful.
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"The sea is clear and beautiful. The only thing is that the restaurant on the island does business in a haphazard manner. When quoting the price, they charged another. I asked for a bowl of squid porridge and a bowl of fish porridge, the young man quoted 200,000 VND, enough for 2-3 people to eat. I agreed and ordered 1 portion of each. When paying, it was 600,000 VND for the squid porridge (with a few slices of squid) and 700,000 VND for the fish porridge. When arguing, he said that he saw 2 people asking the price and thought it was for 2 people so he quoted the price for 2 people, then saw 6 people so he ordered the portion for 6 people? While I pointed out the table I was sitting at and there were other people in the group sitting there. Even though at first I thought they were full, I should have come out and told the customers, right? They also said that there was nothing to bargain about these things, Vietnamese people who go out to eat don't even have any opinion (I went with 5 foreigners). I know that the prices on the island are definitely higher than on the mainland and other places, but I heard the price and thought it was acceptable so I ordered the dish, but when it came to paying the bill, it was different. Our group didn't lack money, if the price was properly quoted at the beginning, the price would be much more expensive than the market price, but it was because I had considered and accepted it, but with this way of doing business, I can only say that I will not return to this island."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Nice attraction
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Great sea island view
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"You may heard about Diep Son via the image of sand roads connecting 3 islands.

Well, it's not there anymore. Diep Son, at the time I went there, can allow you to see only a small part of sand road, and it connected to no other island. Things were different in the past when we can all see it clear and even walk on it.

Guide said to see full road nowaday, we need to go here around 4-5 AM in the morning, when tides at lowest."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Still wild and beautiful. Went during low tide so there was a path to the island in the middle of the sea.
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Wild tourist island with majestic scenery
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Beautiful scenery but lots of trash
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"12/3/2016

I came here when Diep Son had less than 100 households, and only had electricity for a few hours a day

The road was clean, with some sections paved, some still sandy. The houses were simple but solid, and adults and children knew each other

There was a lot of mist, mosquitoes, and cows, and a few scattered houses selling groceries with everything from heaven to earth, like a miniature supermarket on the island

When our group arrived, the island was still very poor, and the children were lacking a lot, but they were very happy.

I only stayed on the island for 24 hours, but I really liked this place. I woke up in the morning by the sea, and on one side was the sunrise over the sea, and on the other side was the road in the middle of the sea that had caused a stir on social networks

If I have the chance, I will definitely come back here again to see how Diep Son has changed in the past 5 years!"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Going from Phu Yen to the island...it feels great going through Ca pass...to the island is very beautiful
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"The pier to go to Diep Son island is about 60km north of Nha Trang city. The island is not too big and there is only one option when going to the island: stop at the restaurant on the island, sightsee, rest, have lunch and wait for the boat to return to the mainland :)) In return, the scenery is very beautiful, white sand + clear water + immense blue sky is an irresistible combo of beautiful scenery"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"The sea water is very clean, but it's a pity that we can't walk all the way to the opposite island"
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"The island is very beautiful but still wild, there is only a speedboat service to take passengers to the island and a small restaurant on the island, the food is cheap and fresh."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Take a local bus (taxi) for 60km to north Nha Trang to Van Gia boat taxi port
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"You need to buy a round-trip ticket for 250,000 at the pier. The first boat will depart at 9:30 and arrive at the island in nearly 20 minutes. The island is very windy and the dunes connecting the two islands are often hidden under the sea.  It may be that tourists are forced to eat lunch on the island. The first return boat will not return until 1 pm, which is very unpleasant. There are few recreational facilities on the island, and the sand is mixed with many stones, which is very rough."
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,So beautiful
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,"This is a very special island and has a wild feeling for those who love quietness and peace of mind. You have to be on time, around 8:00 am to 10:00 am, then there will be a path to go to the other side of the mountain. If you are too late, the water will rise and you will have to wade through the water. But what I like most is the feeling of walking in water up to your knees. It feels a bit scary and extremely relaxing. If you are sad or something, wading through water like this will not be sad anymore because you can see fish and coral! Girls who go this way, especially the timid ones, will feel like they are in an action movie. It's so much fun, laughing and crying while walking.
-Although it's really wild, it's suitable for girls who are dreamy and like to take pictures. Other girls who come here will say ""oh, there's nothing there"" so you should think about your personality and preferences before coming here 😊
Personally, as a writer, I really like this place because every time I drink water, it feels very exciting and strange.

ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,The people is breaking the beauty of nature.
ChIJXRBd7OAbcDERslAehp-V8oU,Ok

ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"We had an incredible experience flying with Fly Vietnam Paragliding Nha Trang! Three of us went up together, and while two of us had an absolutely amazing time, one of our friends was quite scared and also struggled a bit because of sunburn. This made her landing less than perfect, as she couldn’t fully follow the instruction to stretch her legs out. Despite the difficult landing, she suffered no injuries apart from the sunburn she already had.

The staff were attentive, supportive, and professional throughout, and they acted quickly to make sure she was safe and comfortable afterwards. It was very reassuring to see how prepared and responsible they were.

For me personally, I’m actually scared of heights, but I felt surprisingly at ease during the whole flight. Even the ride up the mountain was enjoyable, and once we were in the air, the views were absolutely breathtaking.

Overall, I’d say this was a 10/10 experience—safe, well-organized, and unforgettable. I’d definitely recommend Fly Paragliding Nha Trang to anyone looking for an adventure!
Book with them direct."
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"First time paragliding and absolutely loved it! Great communication with the team on WhatsApp and they were just as lovely and helpful in person!
We added on the GoPro to our experience which we thought was worth it to capture the whole experience.
The drive up to the take off area was very fun too!"
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"I really enjoyed it, but I didn't get to fly right away for a number of reasons (rain on the mountain, strong winds, etc.)
I recommend it to everyone."
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"Best experience paragliding ever!!!! If you love adventure sport this is your must to do thing in Nha Trang. The view is absolute breathtaking, the driver, the pilot and all the staffs are so nice, making the whole experience unforgettable 👍👍👍👍"
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"I really enjoyed the organization of the paragliding flight. Everything was quick, efficient, and safe. Vladislav is an excellent instructor, very friendly, and clearly explained everything a beginner needs to know.
We were also lucky with the weather – it was sunny and the view from the mountain was beautiful! The GoPro video quality is superb.
We were very satisfied and highly recommend him."
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"My first time paragliding. this is amazing. the instructors and staff were patient with giving instruction and coaching. and makes me feel very assured. they will only launch when weather is good and safety is always number 1. they checked equipment many times to ensure no issues. please come and enjoy the great view, weather and experience here. also give refreshments and free gift afterwards"
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"I liked everything about the class, I felt a little sick at all stages, but it was worth it."
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"Thank you Trang and Fly team. The experience of flying from the top of Hon En is really wow wow. The support staff is very enthusiastic and professional, the equipment is very safe and ok. Looking forward to the next flight in Phu Quoc ^^"
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"We had a great flight, the guys explained everything in detail, the road in the Land Cruiser was a separate form of entertainment, and at the end there were also gifts waiting for us"
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,It was really cool. Thank you very much. ☀️
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"Before the program started - I purchased it through Nol Interpark for 100,000 won.
However, I couldn't contact the company until the day before, so I tracked it down myself and contacted them via messenger. (You have to coordinate a time with the company.) If you're interested in this program, it might be easier to contact them via messenger if you don't hear back. The advantage is that you can do it at your preferred time. They also offer pickup service.

Beginner - It's about a 20-minute drive up the mountain.

After the program started - It's really fun. It's definitely worth trying in Nha Trang. You won't regret it. It feels like all your stress has melted away!!! You should definitely try it. It's worth the 100,000 won. It's really fun. You should definitely try it.

If you can resolve the initial contact issue, I think it'll go smoothly. I highly recommend it!!"
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"Paragliding before leaving Vietnam!
They're very thorough and double-check everything, so it's safe. Afterward, they serve drinks and delicious pear-like fruit. The drivers are all friendly and provide free GoPro footage.
You should definitely try it!"
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"It was a wonderful trip! There was an instructor in Russian who explained everything clearly. And the local pilot Kai helped to get unforgettable impressions, I really liked it, at the end they treated me to fresh juice and fruits, awesome!"
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,Wonderful experience. 5 star :)
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"Everything went at the highest level, they gave instructions, there was a Russian-speaking guide who helped with everything
We filmed the video on camera, and immediately sent it after the jump
At the end they treated us to a smoothie and fruit
I recommend it to everyone!!👍🏼👍🏼"
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"A worthwhile experience. From preparation to flight, everything was thoughtful and professional. My instructor (Mr. Quoc Trong) was extremely enthusiastic - 5-star skills. The view from above of the city, ocean, and mountains of Nha Trang is absolutely breathtaking."
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"Very worth it. It's a great experience. The staff is cute, attentive, and dedicated. Better than I expected 👍👍👍"
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,It's so good you should try it even just once it's amazing
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"Great experience👍👍👍
Worth the money♥️♥️♥️"
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"Looking for some fun in the sky?!

We did paramotoring with Fly Vietnam Paragliding and it was absolutely fantastic. The trip followed the river over rice paddies and the city out to Nha Trang Bay and return. Worth every cent!

It is safe and well organised from Ms Nguyen who remained in contact with us from booking to follow up.

The team on the ground did a great job of looking after us."
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"Experience a new feeling, worth experiencing
The road up the mountain is very interesting
The staff is very enthusiastic.
Seeing the scenery of Nha Trang from above is truly indescribable. The feeling of satisfaction from the touch to the sight. Each breeze blowing through the hair, caressing the skin. The scenery of Nha Trang is clearly in front of you. In your ears are the words of encouragement from the pilot.
When you get off, you also prepare smoothies, fruits, and candies. After completing the flight, you will receive a certificate and souvenir from Fly
Next time, I will try to experience other services of FLY"
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,The service is great. The guy who flew with me was very enthusiastic and friendly. 11/10 points.

ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,Beautiful flight location. Very close to Nha Trang city. You can see the sea and the city from here. The take-off and landing areas are both beautiful. The staff is friendly and professional. The company's equipment is very high quality and new.
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"We took the maximum package, we liked everything very much, the instructors are great, they explained and told us everything, during the flight the pilots also prompted and helped if anything, we circled extremely, we are delighted, although we are not fans of such entertainment. Definitely not the last time we fly with FlyVietnam"
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"Great entertainment in Nha Trang. 
I came here for the 3rd year in a row and accidentally found out that you can fly a paraglider! The emotions are incredible, from climbing a mountain to flying with a parachute. I recommend it to those who love heights, want to relieve stress and get a dose of adrenaline! I will definitely fly again in the future."
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"Today I flew over the northern bay of Nha Trang) Well, what can I say - it's just great, the impressions are super, definitely 10/10.

ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"I appreciate the company's support and responsiveness in accomodating to my booking date & timing. I highly recommend booking with this company for paragliding / paramotoring in Vietnam. It was really thrilling to do paramotoring for the first time. Pilot is excellent at steering the paramotor and the flight felt very stable. The views of the Nha Trang beach, mountain landscape, and city skyline from the paramotor is absolutely stunning. I liked the gopro video of my entire flight. location is convenient to city center and I appreciate the round trip transfer."
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"We flew over the coastline of Nha Trang, it was simply amazing!

Additional services complete the experience"

ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"Best Paragliding Experience with Fly Vietnam Paragliding!

I had the most unforgettable experience flying with Fly Vietnam Paragliding! From start to finish, everything was absolutely amazing. The team is professional, friendly, and truly passionate about what they do. They made me feel safe, relaxed, and excited for the flight.

This was my first time flying in Vietnam, and the view from the sky was beyond words—lush green hills, peaceful countryside, rivers, and villages that look like paintings from above. Flying with a bouquet of flowers made it even more magical. It felt like a dream to be floating in the air, carried by the wind, with nature all around me.

My pilot was super experienced and explained everything clearly. The takeoff was smooth, and once in the air, it was pure freedom. We even did a few fun turns and acrobatics, which added to the thrill. They also took amazing photos and videos during the flight, so I can relive the moment again and again.

One thing I loved the most is that everyone can fly! You don’t need any experience, just a little courage and a smile. The team makes sure it’s comfortable for all ages and levels. Whether you’re looking for adventure or just want to enjoy peaceful views, this is for you.

I highly recommend Fly Vietnam Paragliding to anyone visiting Vietnam. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience that you’ll never forget. If you want to do something extraordinary, fly with them. You’ll feel alive, free, and full of joy.

Thank you, Fly Vietnam team, for this beautiful memory. I will definitely come back again! 🪂🇻🇳💐"

ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,So awesome
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"We booked the Premium round-trip transfer. Boy, glad we did that. saved us time. Mr. Huy co-ordinated the transport for us to and from the hotel. The experience itself was amazing. Very strong winds and clear blue skies made the experience more wonderful. Mr. Long was an incredible pilot and did a stunt for me at my request. Capturing it on Go-Pro is a must-do if you are planning to paraglide or tandem glide. Mrs. Long welcomed us with a big smile and her hospitality cannot be forgotten. She chatted with us despite language issues using translator, patiently. I absolutely love the wonderful experience. I would come again to glide with Fly Vietnam Paragliding."
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,An absolutely unforgettable paragliding experience! Pilot Bishnu was incredibly skilled and professional – his expertise made me feel completely safe while enjoying breathtaking views.

Highly recommend this team to anyone seeking an amazing flight!
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"great, I felt great from the moment I took the car to the top of the mountain
Note: You should register for the highest premium package to have good services such as pick-up in Nha Trang city, take-off and landing, and fly for a long time. I chose the medium package so I had to go there myself, but the road to get there was small and difficult. Taxis also called me."
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"I had a really amazing experience here, flying with the pilot was great. They were super friendly, and after the flight, we even got fruit, drinks, and a gift too."

Such a FREEDOM, nothing blocking the view at all. 😃 And for the service, there’s nothing to complain about: staff are super friendly, dedicated with the skilled and ""easy to talk"" pilots.

ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"Hon En trekking palace brings a cool, pleasant feeling, the path weaves through diverse natural scenes: walking under the forest canopy, rich herbal carpet to grasslands, clear lakes, blue sea and even the view of Nha Trang city from afar. It's hot at the foot of the mountain, but entering the forest is very pleasant.

The climbing journey ends with an exhilarating paragliding experience. Flying with a professional pilot, modern equipment and ensuring safety, the feeling of ""flying"" from the top of the mountain, taking in all the scenery as far as you can see is truly an unforgettable memory."
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,Beautiful area and very friendly professional people. It was great fun. Everything was well taken care of. Everything was very professional and safe.

The team of pilots and staff here are so enthusiastic in supporting customers. After flying, I have a clip right away. Highly recommend everyone to try this tour when coming to Nha Trang"

ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"From the moment I arrived at the Fly Vietnam Paragliding reception area, I felt the professionalism and enthusiasm of the staff. They not only welcomed me warmly but also gave me detailed and dedicated instructions on the flight procedures as well as safety precautions. This really helped me feel more secure and excited than ever.

When it was my turn to fly, I met my co-pilot - an extremely friendly and experienced person. The professionalism and meticulousness in every action of the pilot made me feel absolutely safe, ready for this special experience.
The moment I left the ground, I was a little shaken by the wind, feeling a little nervous, but quickly all my worries seemed to disappear, leaving only a feeling of freedom and extreme excitement. The wind blew, the vast sky opened up before my eyes, the natural scenery, the endless rice fields. Flying like a bird, watching everything from above is a truly unforgettable feeling.
I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Fly Vietnam Paragliding team for providing me with such a memorable and wonderful experience. From the reception, the preparation support, to the moment of soaring in the air - everything was perfect down to the last detail. I will definitely come back and recommend this experience to my friends and relatives!

When it was my turn to fly, I met my companion pilot - an incredibly friendly and experienced person. The professionalism and meticulousness in every maneuver made me feel absolutely safe and ready for this special experience. 

The moment I took off from the ground, there was a slight wobble due to the wind, and I felt a bit nervous at first. However, that feeling quickly faded away, leaving only a sense of ultimate freedom and exhilaration. The wind rushed past, the vast sky unfolded before my eyes, and the breathtaking natural scenery with endless rice fields stretched out below. Soaring through the air like a bird and taking in the panoramic view from above was truly an unforgettable experience.

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the Fly Vietnam Paragliding team for giving me such a wonderful and memorable experience. From the warm reception and thorough preparation support to the exhilarating moments soaring through the sky – everything was flawless down to the smallest detail.

ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,"I was so nervous. When the flight was over, I was overwhelmed :) Nature is so beautiful. It was my first time seeing a helicopter. What a great experience! I even got a certificate from the pilot himself. So memorable! Thank you for being so dedicated and giving me all the best. I hope you always bring this wonderful joy to everyone."
ChIJ5_QGpEtDcDERhH-oTN4kq90,Interesting experience. Enthusiastic advice. Stable service. Paragliding is very smooth.

ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"A beautiful, secluded place) I want to return to this beach) If you want to have a beautiful holiday on a beautiful beach with a clean sea, then this is the beach to go to 👏"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Nhu Tien Beach is very private, suitable for teambuilding activities. The beach is very gentle, the water is clear and blue and the waves are not too strong. Located in the heart of the arc and protected by mountains, the sun is bright but the wind is very cool. I just need to lie under the shade of a coconut tree, drink coconut water and look out at the blue sea to feel completely healed ;p"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"The sea here is calm and cool, the water is clear enough to see the bottom. The wind blows gently, the waves are not strong so it feels very comfortable. There are no crowds, no noise, just listening to the sound of the sea is comfortable. Sitting for a while makes you forget all your tiredness, just want to stay longer to breathe the sea breeze and watch the waves gently lapping."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"The beach is great, the waves aren't too strong, sun loungers are included, there's a swing, plenty of room for photos, and fine sand. The only thing is, by evening, there was a lot of trash in the sea. The food is also expensive; we ordered pancakes, which were very greasy, and they agreed to refund or replace them."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"So, my honest opinion about this beach. It's far from the center (okay). The staff at the entrance were very disgruntled and rude (we paid 160,000 dong for two). We arrived at the beach and, lo and behold (we arrived around 11 a.m.), there were no free sun loungers (tourists, oh my!). They leave their towels on the sun loungers and don't lie down, so we had to settle down on the sand. Towels aren't included in the price (60,000 for two). I'd say it's some kind of special beach, but unfortunately, it's not. It would be better if they sold sun loungers instead of entrance to the beach... half of the guests would definitely have left, and there would have been room for tourists with money. Overall, the taxi cost 150,000 dong one way. And we essentially received zero service. So, I don't recommend it! Better go to Marina Beach."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Nhu Tien Beach is a beautiful and tranquil beach located in Phu Yen Province, Vietnam. Known for its clean sand, clear turquoise waters, and peaceful surroundings, it is an ideal destination for visitors seeking relaxation away from crowded tourist spots.

The beach offers a serene environment with gentle waves and soft sandy shores, perfect for swimming, sunbathing, or leisurely walks along the coastline. The natural landscape, framed by rocky outcrops and lush greenery, provides excellent opportunities for photography and enjoying the coastal scenery.

Local seafood vendors nearby offer fresh and authentic dishes, adding a cultural and culinary touch to the visit. The quiet atmosphere and unspoiled beauty make Nhu Tien Beach a great choice for families, couples, and solo travelers looking for a peaceful coastal retreat.

Whether visiting for a day or staying longer to enjoy the surrounding nature, Nhu Tien Beach leaves a lasting impression with its calm waters, scenic views, and relaxing ambiance."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"To be fair, this is a beautiful beach, swimmable, with few waves due to the special terrain, a fence to limit access and lifeguards on duty, towels, life jackets and other food and drink rentals, the ticket price includes fresh water showers, and there are quite a few foreigners. However, it is advisable to avoid weekends because it is crowded and there are often group guests going on team building trips, so it is quite noisy. The next minus point is the chairs, and although the beach is quite large, there are not enough chairs for a few dozen guests to swim, and the staff supporting this area is also limited."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Nhũ Tiên Beach

After reading rave reviews, I went to check it out, but it wasn't my cup of tea.
It's 11 km from the South of Nya (about 17 minutes).
Entrance is 80K, and a sun lounger is included.

This is a beach area on the hotel grounds. I had no idea where to go, so I chose a ""wild"" road. I ended up changing in an abandoned building. I even parked my bike haphazardly, which was eventually rolled away to the parking lot. I had to find it again. 😆

➕The sand is beautiful white, there's a swing and a hammock, the view is very beautiful, the entry into the sea is gentle, but I managed to find some rocks when I entered the water. As a result, you feel ""penned in"" in the water; there's no sense of freedom because the area in the water is buoyed. But it's beautiful for photos, beautiful indeed. There are cages with Bambi and peacocks, but I didn't have time to look for my bike.

➖The rock is closed for photos, and there's trash and bags floating in the water that were cleared out in front of us (there hasn't been any rain for a week, so it just carries in from the sea in the evenings), so I can't comment on that. But the city beach closer to the south of NY is much cleaner for me, only the sand is steeper here.
I couldn't find a changing room, and the bar is overpriced.

Next time I'll go to a wild, free beach further away from here; I don't see the point of paying for admission beyond a sunbed. But, as they say, tastes differ 🙃."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"The beach is crap, entrance is 80, then another 30 for towels, all the sunbeds are under palm trees, they don't let you move them in the sun, the sea is ordinary, it's better to go to Amiana Beach, there is construction going on nearby, everything is old"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"We were there in the evening after 4:00 PM.
The water was very murky, there was trash in the sand, even though they were cleaning it up, and huge crab holes.
There were renovations going on in the area (the sounds were correspondingly pleasant.)
The zoo had exhausted deer and peacocks.
Entrance fee: 80,000.
There really weren't many people there; maybe things would be different in the morning, but I have no desire to come back."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"There is no privacy or beautiful water here, the rocks in the water are unsafe, this is the very case when expectation is reality, but out of boredom you can go once, and construction nearby during people's vacation is absurd, you either build or do business, and here everything is at once"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Gorgeous beach, clear water, secluded, not crowded! There's an entrance fee of 80,000 rubles, but there are sun loungers, umbrellas, and so on, all included in the price, plus clean restrooms and showers! There's a cafe with cold beer. What else could you want? I recommend it."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,White sand and clear water
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"They charge 80,000 rubles per person at the entrance. The grounds are undergoing renovations and are in a state of disrepair; there's no running water in the sinks, no showers (it's impossible to wash up after the sand).
They keep about four bembis, which sit in the heat without water. They have no cooling pools, and it looks sad. The peacocks are sad too.
To get to the women's restroom, you have to pass open men's urinals 😂

There's a small rock with a nice photo spot, but the rock is closed and there's a sign warning against climbing.

Tea at the buffet is 70,000 rubles (20-25,000 rubles in the city). There's no bottled water, and you can't buy drinks from the refrigerator; only their drinks are expensive.

Pros: beautiful! The mountains are a beautiful backdrop. Soft, sticky sand, very fine and pleasant! The beach is cleaned. Sun loungers are free (included in the ticket price).
The water is warm and clear (assuming there wasn't a storm before). There are no rocks, just fine sand. The entry is long and gentle, so it's perfect for families with children.
Along the way, you can also see the river and beautiful mountains."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"A nice beach. There aren't many people, everyone is spaced out, and doesn't get in the way. You can't hear traffic, conversations, screams, or anything else. It's quiet and peaceful. I liked the beach. The menu is limited, but you can grab a bite. It's definitely worth getting away from the hustle and bustle; it's quiet and comfortable. You can hear the sea and the rustling palm trees."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Beautiful deserted beach. The water is very clean and clear. You should go and experience it, everyone."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Our perfect beach day started right here—and it was worth the entrance fee! 💸
For a nominal fee (80,000 VND per person), you get:
✅ A clean, well-maintained beach without crowds
✅ Sun loungers and umbrellas shaded by palm trees
✅ Free Wi-Fi
✅ Comfortable showers and changing rooms

They built a huge sand castle with towers and a moat 😄 The sand here is soft, not rocky—perfect for creativity.

Lunch was a delight! 🍤
We ordered fresh grilled shrimp, a banana smoothie, and banh mi—everything was delicious, the prices were reasonable, and the waiters were smiling. We ate right under a palm tree, listening to the sound of the waves—wasn't that bliss?

💡 Tip:
Bring sunscreen—there's some shade, but the sun is strong!

📌 P.S. We spent the whole day here—visiting the castle, swimming, filming, working on our laptop, having lunch, and watching the sunset!

ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"A disgusting and dirty beach. The sea is disgusting and dirty, covered in plastic and brown stains."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"The worst beach we've ever seen in Vietnam.
The view is beautiful, the infrastructure is excellent.
But the amount of trash is horrendous, you can't get into the water.
It's really disgusting; the bags scrape against your feet.
A waste of time and money."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"We paid 80k for entry, they said there would be a pool and sun loungers with a towel, but there was NOTHING! Don't waste your time and money!"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Beautiful, pristine beach with restaurants, bars, and shops selling swimwear and more. A deserted destination but still a good choice for swimming and chilling when traveling to Nha Trang."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,The beach is very beautiful
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"There is trash in the ocean. Everyone, please take a piece of trash that you accidentally pass by. 🙏🏻"

ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,Mom team building affects private space😡
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Entrance fee is 80k/person, Diamond Bay beach. Clean, has bathroom after swimming, has restaurant selling food"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Quiet, spacious beach, ok food, reasonable price
Cons: beach has trash, limited bathrooms"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Nhu Tien is about 10km from NTrang city, cars follow GG Maps, the road is difficult to get to because there is a narrow road with a width of only 2.6m. I don't know which way the bus goes.
+Sea: 80 fish 1 ticket for adults. If you go in August, you should choose to go in the morning, the water will be clear. After 11am the water will be cloudy and the north wind will start to blow in, so there is a lot of trash. The sand is fine and smooth to walk on but hot on the feet, there are jellyfish here and happily there is a baby pomfret that got lost and got into the car, quite cute
+Service: Normally not special, the lockers also need to be maintained, couples don't know how to keep their belongings. There are staff to collect trash and blow the whistle if you leave the safe area with the net.
+Food: Expensive, Thai hotpot with all chili oil (satirical sauce), a piece of fish, some mussels and shrimp for 510k, steamed lemongrass chicken or lemongrass stew for 280k, just a few bites and it's gone
=> In short: Will come back but bring your own food to eat more comfortably, the food surcharge is only 30 fish per person, why not bring your own. Everyone, remember to prepare towels and drinking water."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Go in mid-August 2025

The food is ok but the fried eggs are bland, the Sichuan tofu is “unsold”, the whole table has a lot left. The other dishes are ok

The beach is ok but the bathroom is very small =)))) no hangers and it's scary dark"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"We were here with friends, very admission costs 80 dong, there is a parking lot for bikes"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Beautiful, but there are stones at the bottom, not very clean.
Pros: there is a place to change clothes, a bar, sun loungers
Beautiful nature"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Horrible place.
Not enough sunbeds, disgusting food, dirty beach.
Don't waste your time
The worst tom yum is here."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Absolute garbage, don't go here.
1 - You can only swim 14 meters out
2 - You have to pay 80,000
3 - There are sharp stones everywhere in the water
4 - The beach and water are very dirty
5 - The music is disgustingly loud
6 - There are only about 25 loungers on the entire beach

If I could give it 0 stars, I would do it immediately"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"This beach is a disgrace.
The sand is dirty, the water is filthy, and there’s plastic waste everywhere. Animals are kept in tiny cages, which is absolutely unacceptable. On top of that, they have the audacity to charge an entrance fee of 80,000 VND per person.
Stay away from this beach."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"In some places the sand is dirty and there are very few sun loungers, it is better to come in the morning. Entrance fee is 80k dong. Prices for drinks are twice as high as usual. Overall it is ok."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"The place looks beautiful at first glance, but the water is REALLY DIRTY, there is a lot of garbage, a person goes and cleans it up, but everything comes from the water: bottles, bags, candy wrappers, etc. At 17 you will be asked to leave, because everything is closed. In the bar on the beach we got poisoned by a cocktail with wires inside, it's CRAZY. THEY NEED TO CALL THE SANITARY STATION, no less, they do such crazy things. The entrance is 80 thousand dong, not much, but you also want to swim in clean water, you can clean more often, and not just relax!!"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Nature itself has created a beautiful atmosphere and beach, but unfortunately there is a huge amount of garbage on the beach and even more in the water. It is unclear why you have to pay for entry if there is garbage everywhere."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"There is no information, we arrived at 4 o'clock, security turned us away. The beach is open from 7:00 to 16:00. The rest of the time is for hotel guests"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"We're Spanish, specifically Catalan, and we come from a land where the beaches are truly spectacular. We have the Costa Brava, with its rocky coves and clear waters; the Costa Dorada, with its extensive beaches of fine sand; and the Costa del Sol, internationally known for its beauty and atmosphere. So, when we visited Nu Thien Beach in Vietnam, we were somewhat excited, hoping to find something exotic, different, but equally attractive. However, the reality was quite disappointing.

We didn't find the beaches at Nu Thien particularly beautiful. The water never completely covers the surface, which may be fine for families with children, but it's not what we were looking for. It was also a bit murky, with a dirty feel that didn't encourage swimming. And the sand... that kind of sand that sticks to you everywhere and is uncomfortable both for walking and for lying down.

We're not saying it's a bad place, or that you can't enjoy it. Simply put, from our perspective and with the references we have at home, Nu Thien Beach fell far short of our expectations. We felt it was not enough."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"The beach is inside the resort, ticket 80k/person bought at the beach gate. The sea is cool, super deep, small and pretty but there is team building so it's not noisy...."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"The beach is beautiful, but very dirty.
I understand that the last couple of days have been strong winds and waves, but everything that washes up on the shore can be cleaned up in an hour. And the entrance fee is 80k/person. Getting there from the city by taxi is another 130k one way.

As a result, you can't go into the water after lunch, there is not a single patch where you can swim without being afraid of being covered in bags, candy wrappers, cups, bottles. Before lunch, you can swim a little, but also in trash - not much fun.

The food is not tasty. Rice with seafood is rice with Hawaiian mix and 3 mini shrimps and a piece of squid. That's it.

There are not many sun loungers and by 11 they are all already taken, but there are wooden chairs, in a huge number. So you will have to sunbathe on a towel (30k/piece - you can rent one at the bar).

While we were relaxing, crowds of people arrived, set up speakers on both sides of us, and started blasting different music in the speakers - it was some kind of mass corporate party there.

In short, you won't find any privacy there, and you won't be able to take a nice photo either.
For trying to get to the rocks to watch the crabs - a whistle from the lifeguard."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,WHAT IS THIS? We came to a private beach and there was just a bunch of garbage lying in the sea... it's absolutely not pleasant to swim here
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Beautiful beach, with mountains and green coconut trees. Many Russians come here to relax. The sand is very fine."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Anyone can get to the beach for 80,000 dong. There is a mini-zoo with deer and peacocks on the territory, however, the peacocks are cramped, the cage is small.
There are not enough sunbeds, it is better to take them in advance, most guests sit on chairs.
The sea is very polluted, there is a lot of garbage and brown spots on the water. Compared to this beach, the city beach of Nha Trang seems much cleaner.
Almost every day there are events with loud music."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,Closes at 5pm. Guard is rude and needs to get a personality.
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"The worst beach in Nha Trang 😞
I came back there a few months later - and it got even worse. Now on one strip of the beach there are three stages at once, from each of which different music is blaring at full volume. There is garbage everywhere that no one cleans up. And in the water and on the sand - a bunch of transparent jellyfish."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,quiet private beach
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Beautiful, quiet beach. They cleaned it right in front of us, but unfortunately there was still some garbage floating in the water. The road to the beach is very beautiful, I liked the place)"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"I liked the beach. We took a taxi from the center of Nha Trang for 130 thousand rubles straight to the beach through the hotel territory. Entrance fee: 80,000. Sun loungers, several shops, cafes, SPA. Very civilized. Beautiful territory with many places for good photos. The only downside is a lot of garbage in the sea. The staff cleans it from the shore every half hour, but there is a lot in the water. There is a mini zoo at the entrance to the beach. Peacocks, deer... If you don't count the garbage in the water, this is a wonderful place to relax. You can take an electric car back to the hotel entrance and call a taxi there. I think I'll come here again."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,Team play is fun
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,Beautiful and quiet... Enjoy every minute...
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Very average beach for a tropical destination. The entrance to the actual beach is 80k VND per adult. The beach itself comprises of smaller part of the entire area. There are more scenic spots along diverging paths that offer picturesque views for free, but the staff aggressively discourages visitors from stopping to take photos or enjoy these areas. We were rudely confronted by an older security guard, cigarette in mouth, riding a rusty scooter, who chased us away from one such spot. His demeanor was hostile and unprofessional, trailing us just 2-3 meters behind as we returned to the main path, as if we were trying to sneak away. At the exit gate, when we paused briefly, he waved his hand and shouted “Go!”—the only English word he seemed to know. This level of rudeness was unwarranted and left a sour impression. The management needs to retrain their staff or reconsider who represents their business. Such unprofessional behavior tarnishes Vietnam’s reputation as a welcoming destination. I strongly recommend avoiding this place unless you want a frustrating and unwelcoming experience. There are far better beaches and attractions to explore."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"In principle, as a beach, the place is beautiful. There is trash, yes, on the shore, it is cleaned up. But jellyfish! On the first day of staying at the hotel, both my husband and I got a burn"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"We arrived at 4:15 pm, but they didn't let us in. They told us to come tomorrow."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"The beach is very beautiful, picturesque. I did not like that no one warns that there are jellyfish in the sea. My child and me, and I also know other visitors were bitten by jellyfish. The bite is painful. There is a lifeguard on the shore who provided first aid. There is also a lot of garbage floating in the water, seaweed. But despite this, the beach is simply stunning in its natural beauty and well-groomedness."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,The beach is so beautiful
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Basically, a great beach – well-maintained with clean sand. Toilets and showers are available and kept clean. Beautiful view of the bay. There is also a bar and food available on site.

However, it’s noticeable that tour buses regularly arrive with large groups of visitors, particularly from East and Southeast Asia. Many of them take part in organized tours, including music performances and drone shows, which dominate the beach atmosphere. This makes it difficult to truly relax. Additionally, at the entrance, some animals such as deer and peacocks are kept in conditions that do not appear to meet good animal welfare standards."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Cool place, I recommend it"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,Great beach!
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,Quiet and clean beach
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Very beautiful and quiet place. The territory is quiet, calm music plays, peacocks sing. Fine and soft sand. The beach itself is not perfectly clean and the water too."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Came in early summer afternoon. No sea breeze because the beach is surrounded by mountains? Quiet and quite beautiful scenery, food probably not very good. Invited so don't know the price!"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"The restaurant space is airy, the food is quite good, the service is good."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"The water is very dirty, there is a lot of garbage."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Clear blue sea, long white sand beach, suitable for tourists to swim, companies to do teambuilding activities"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"The beach itself is incredibly beautiful, but you have to pay an entrance fee and the animal treatment is completely unacceptable. I wouldn't go there again knowing this."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Beautiful, white sand, yellow sunshine and blue sea"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Nhũ Tiên Beach is a good option if you are not afraid of tourist buses.

The beach is paid - 80,000 dong. It is located next to the Diamond Bay Resort. The territory is well-kept, the beach is cleaned closer to lunchtime. There is a restaurant, bar, sun loungers, showers, hammocks. You cannot bring your own food - formally. In fact: if you do not get caught, you can. If they notice, they will ask you to pay a fine or leave. Your choice.

The sand is clean, the sea is transparent, the bottom is shallow. There is a net and buoys to prevent trash from floating in. After 12 noon it becomes especially pleasant: sun, shade from palm trees, the water is almost glassy.

On the territory - a mini-park with deer and cows. Small, but nice.

Cons:
- few sun loungers in the morning
- if a bus with Chinese or Koreans arrives - the vacation is over. It gets noisy and crowded, as if you were on a factory tour. It's better to wait it out in a bar or just leave.

Fact to remember: in 2008, the Miss Universe contest was held here. Now there are cows here. Such is the universal irony.

Result:
The beach is good. But you can only relax until the organized groups arrive."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"It's a lovely place, peaceful atmosphere."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Looks really nice in the photos, but I arrived at the gate at about 6pm and the guard said the beach is closed, so I imagine the closing time is 5 or 6 😔

Maybe I dodged a bullet, judging by some of the other reviews 😅"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"We made it to the beach today! I read a lot of reviews, even watched videos, but in the end I couldn't figure out how to get to the beach—through the hotel grounds or not.
We called a taxi directly to the beach's name, and it took us right there.
We arrived at 11:30 AM. It was windy, and there was already trash in the water and on the shore, but you can find a place where there isn't! It's very quiet and beautiful.

Entrance is 80,000 rubles, and you can choose a sunbed. They say there aren't many—yes, there aren't many, but we had enough and even had some left. The views are beautiful, everything is green, an oasis!

The prices at the bar are reasonable, cocktails are 75-95 rubles.

Around 1:30 PM, they come to clean up the trash on the beach.
I recommend going by car or bike."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Very calm sea, beautiful beach, sun loungers, umbrella, everything is there, equipped beach! Entrance ticket price 80,000 VND per person"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,Can I ask if there is camping service at Nhu Tien beach?
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"A very beautiful beach. There are small islands with seaweed and tons of little fish. The beach looks like a postcard. It's a secluded bay with no big waves. The water is clean. There's a mini-zoo (peacocks and deer). Admission is charged unless you're staying at the Diamond Bay Condo Hotel. There are few sun loungers, mostly chairs and sun loungers. SUPs and kayaks are available for rent, and there's a bar and restaurant."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Nice beach, on the territory there is a mini zoo, a bar, sun loungers, hammocks, entrance costs 80,000 dong, one star was removed because they didn’t tell the reception that you could ride bikes to the beach yourself, they put us in a shuttle, charged us an additional 50,000 dong, we walked back a couple of kilometers in the dark because no one came for us 😭"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Nhu Tien is a beach located near Cam Ranh airport, about 10km from Nha Trang city. Nhu Tien is located in Phuoc Ha village, Phuoc Dong commune, Nha Trang city, Khanh Hoa province. Nhu Tien Nha Trang tourist area has just been put into operation so it is still very wild and is one of the few beautiful beaches on the mainland. With its own unique beauty, Nhu Tien is one of the Nha Trang tourist destinations that is worth visiting once in your life. 
Entrance fee to Nhu Tien Nha Trang beach:
Adult: 75,000 VND/person
Children: 50,000 VND/person"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"The beach is pitch black but beautifully decorated, quite deserted, no Vietnamese guests"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,Pretty
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"The best beach near Nha Trang. Quiet, cozy, and beautiful.
Just avoid coming between 9 a.m. and 12 noon on Saturdays and Sundays, when crowds of Asians arrive by the busload."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Cool and clean. 80k adult ticket: 1 hut, 1 hammock, 1 beach"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Very bad feeling, to see and to can not  reach it.. because is private ....."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"It's a beautiful stand, but the animals are kept in such cruel conditions. It's very sad."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,Can I have any tickets?
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"I decided to look at the color of the water on this beach, I was unsure whether to go or not, I decided to go, it’s not visible from a distance, I had to go in, the entrance is 80 VND. There was a very large group of tourists from China, a lot of people, music, songs. I left my things on the sunbed, and there was a Chinese man on another sunbed nearby. Today I was even glad that it was fashionable to leave things quietly on a paid beach, but that was not the case. Returning from the water, I discovered that money had been stolen from my wallet, about 17 thousand rubles in transfer. Naturally, there was no point in looking for some Chinese from the million buses that had already left, and there were almost no cameras on the beach. As a result, the color of the water is the same as in the city, in general it’s no better than a regular city beach, and they steal here too, fuck it!!!? It’s much better to go to zoklet, where I was practically alone and the water was fire, compared to this beach. On the way out I told the security about the theft, he told the manager, at least they would return the money for entry, they just apologized and that’s all. What if I had no more money at all???? In general, I definitely do not recommend this beach."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Private Beach style
Food is frozen food from Convenience store"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"I went with my family and a small child.
The sand is fine, the water is clear.
The access road is internal, not crowded.
The downside is that there are not many services, there is an extra charge for bringing food."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"I won't be back. Pros: they clean up the trash, there's a bar, they even make pizza, but there's not much to choose from. Entrance is 80,000 rubles, children under 1.2m are 40,000 rubles. Cons: there was a horde of Vietnamese schoolchildren screaming and jumping around on Sunday. There were also a lot of Russian tourists. There are few umbrellas, even fewer sun loungers, towels are thrown on everyone, and no one is lying down.

Entering through the gates of the Diamond Bay Hotel, the hotel is either abandoned or looks abandoned; the grounds are vast, but neglected. There is security."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Beautiful picturesque beach. If there were no groups of children (I understand schoolchildren on an excursion), it would be quiet, I advise you to come on weekdays. I take off a star for the garbage in the water and on the sand. Otherwise, everything is fine. Entrance is 80,000, towels are 30,000, food in the restaurant is 2x more expensive than in other places. Much better beach than many city ones. There is also a problem with sun loungers, there are few of them, mostly chairs, I had to lay towels just on the concrete in the shade"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"This is a very good beach for Nha Trang. Enter through the Diamond Bay Hotel, then go to the beach, pay 80 dong, and you're on the beach. It feels like a resort. I highly recommend it."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Beautiful beach. No strong waves, suitable for children to swim. But the bathroom is a bit dirty."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Nice beach, not many people"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Beautiful beach, few people."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"The ticket is not refundable , after we entered karaoke started to play full volume.
If you want to chill stay away from here."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Entrance is 80,000 dong.
The grounds are beautiful, with indoor and outdoor showers, restrooms, a restaurant, a bar, and even caged peacocks, pigeons, and deer.
The sea is calm, with no waves. And overall, the atmosphere is peaceful.
But there's a huge BUT!
There's trash on the beach and in the water. And it's not the trash that comes with the tide, but locally sourced trash.
If you've made the beach a paid beach, at least keep it clean."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Nice, clean beach, nice staff. Admission is 80000dong. You get a bed, an umbrella, there is a bar. Good place, I would come back."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"A nice beach, the area is actively maintained. We were heading to a nearby beach with activities but didn’t regret stopping here at all. It reminded me of Surin Beach in Phuket."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Cool, clean, soft sand"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"The beach is beautiful, small, clean, and has lifeguards, but unfortunately I went during a rainy season so it was quite cloudy. If you are a guest of Diamond Bay, the ticket is free and there is an electric car that takes you there."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"The best beach 💪🙏🚀
Entrance 80,000.
In 2008, the Miss Universe contest was held here 🍾"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,nice beach
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"pay pay pay, you have to pay for everything"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Spacious, airy and beautiful"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Clean beautiful beach. Entrance 80 thousand dong per person. There are cafes, toilets and showers"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Great beach. While the main beaches have huge waves, here everything is calm."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"The beach is very beautiful and idyllic. Everything is very well maintained!

Unfortunately, there was a noisy school trip one day, and a team-building event the next. The noise made it impossible to enjoy the beach.

There's also a mini zoo. Animals, including peacocks and deer, are kept here in terrible conditions. Totally unnecessary and sad!"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Peaceful beach, friendly people, will come back next time..."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,normal beach
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Nhu Tien beach is absolutely stunning! The water is clear, the sand is soft, the scenery is wild and peaceful. Coming here, you can relax and escape all the noise and fatigue. It is truly an ideal place to recharge your batteries!"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,Great clean beach. Worth a visit
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Known as one of the beautiful beaches in Khanh Hoa province, Nhu Tien beach attracts you with its clear blue water and long sandy beach like a sleeping fairy in the vast space of the sky and earth. You can enjoy swimming, enjoy the fresh air or experience water sports such as paragliding, canoeing, windsurfing... Nhu Tien beach is also a place often chosen to organize dynamic and youthful Team building activities."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Pros:
- beautiful beach;
- tables with chairs;
- you can bring your own meat and rent a grill;
- after sunset there was music, a show, and fireworks.

Cons:
- dirty sea with plastic bags and other garbage floating in large quantities;
- we found out in advance whether we could bring our own meat and cook it ourselves. We were told that we couldn't cook on our own grill, but they showed us a menu that said that the restaurant could cook our meat for an extra fee. On day X we arrived and were told that they wouldn't cook the meat. The staff wasn't interested in helping us at all. Eventually, thanks to our persistence, they called the administrator, who said that we could use the grill for an extra fee.
- There is a ""zoo"" on the premises, the animals are kept in small cages. The deer are in an enclosure that has nothing but concrete. A terrible sight."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"A beautiful, clean, peaceful, and romantic beach!
We got free admission with our Diamond Bay Condotel stay!
A place we'd love to visit again!"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"We arrived at 15:00, the beach is dirty, the water is dirty, it's unpleasant to swim :) there's a cool area around to walk around, but you shouldn't come here specifically to swim. The entrance fee is 80,000, considering all this I won't be back here again."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,Maybe it's because the time I went was not nice. The sea water was not as clear and clean as expected.
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,Beautiful beach. Clean. Quiet....
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Minh Came in August. Nice view. But the beach has little sand, shallow water, and trash. The jellyfish sting combo is a bit itchy."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"The beach is full of trash even though the trash collectors are on duty cleaning it up continuously. The water is muddier than other beaches. If you go to the end of the shore and climb inside, you will see a small corner for taking beautiful pictures."
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"I came with my company for a camping team building in the evening so it was quite great, drinking and joking around, overall it was very fun, the beach was clean and private very ok"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,This place is trying to change. The beach is calm and clean. The service is changing. The breakfast combo and free service from Monday to Thursday is quite good.
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Clean sea, smooth sand"
ChIJbYsiVpFgcDER8jMDvlyUFYI,"Nhu Tien Beach - is one of the few beaches on the mainland that possesses a rare beauty in Nha Trang. This location is located right on the road connecting Cam Ranh airport and Cam Ranh city. Only about 10 km from the city center, hidden behind the undulating rocky mountains stretching out to the sea. Surrounded by high mountains, the sea here is quite calm. Although this beach was put into tourism exploitation a dozen years ago, its wild, interesting features and especially the quiet space. Perhaps this is the point that attracts tourists to come here."

My baby is all grown up, so I came back again. It's still great~~

A healing spot I really want to keep to myself! The camping showers and restrooms are so well-maintained, and it's a great place for dogs. The facilities are clean. Best of all, the barbecue is cheap. It was 350,000 or 450,000 VND for two people. And the extras weren't that much!!! Shrimp, chicken, octopus, pork jowl, corn, ribs, etc. were all grilled and delicious~~ Most of the people there were Vietnamese, and we were the only foreigners, but the staff cooked for us and helped us, which made us even happier~~ I don't think I'll be able to come back if it becomes more famous to Koreans, so I won't write a blog review...!!!!ㅋㅋㅋㅋ I'll write one next time I go. I'll come again❤ I'm so happy to see you all here❤"
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,A great place for camping with friends
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,Slow service.
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"good service, cheerful, enthusiastic, attentive staff
good tent, full of toilet tools *although no spring in tent*, large toilet (lots of rubbish on shelves, no hot and cold water)
large toilet, with sprayer, sink (no paper and hand washing water)
delicious dinner and breakfast, enough to fill
when I went, there was no filtered water, a bit sad because filtered water is super necessary

overall I think it's good, maybe because I'm easygoing, I will come back hehe"
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"The view here is quite beautiful.. the sea view at night is very chill.. there is free sup paddling and you can bring your own food and drinks and they are also served for free.. The grilled food in the evening and morning for 2 people is just enough and quite delicious, very tasty.. The staff is cute and friendly
The minus point is that during the day the tent is too hot, even though there are 2 fans. The carpet in the tent is dirty and itchy.. Hopefully May will fix these 2 points.. If I have the chance, I will come back again"
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"Too bad, unfriendly. Dishonest."
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"I've heard it since I was born. Now that I've heard it, I'll be scared forever 🥶🥶🥶"
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"Service 10/10, enthusiastic support staff, will come back"
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"On September 9, my group of 5 people went and stayed here.

I also wrote a few words about my first experience staying and using the service here.

- Space: Cool, chill, airy afternoon. 10/10 points
If you want to find a place to heal outside the city but don't have time to go far, this is the place to go.

- Service: A bit slow because the area has not been assigned to the staff, but in return, the enthusiasm and joy of the staff, from the security guard to the service staff to the cleaning lady, not to forget the enthusiastic and funny manager. 9/10 points
- Facilities: Personally, I have been camping in many places in the forest, so here provides relatively enough amenities for customers, but for those who are not used to camping, they will feel less than staying in a hotel, but for me, it is not a problem when there is a little lack. 9/10 points
- Food and drinks: I think the food is just okay, the shrimp is a bit greasy, but overall it's okay. Our group paid for our own beer and drinks, and the camp supported us with free service charge, which is a big plus. 8.5/10 points.
On behalf of the group, I would like to thank Duy (I don't know if he remembers the name correctly because he was too drunk at that time, if not, I apologize) for welcoming our group warmly and happily. If we have the chance, my brothers and I will come back because my younger brother only caught 2 sea urchins, and he wasn't satisfied :)))))).
Thank you May and thank you May's team very much."
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,Very good service well worth it
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"Delicious food, beautiful view"
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"Cool view, clean, enthusiastic. Will recommend to friends to experience."
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"I was a bit surprised that the toilet + bathroom for men and women were shared, but the ceiling was designed with a blue mirror that revealed that while I was showering, I accidentally looked up and saw the entire room next door, so my wife had to ask someone to watch so that the men wouldn't shower next to me, which was very impolite. The staff was also enthusiastic, but if I needed anything, I had to wait a long time, there was no one on duty, the tent was hot and sunny... I ordered coffee but waited all day and still didn't see it, it was only 8:00-8:30, my group had to go home immediately. Honestly, the sea view and chill sup rowing were fine, but there was nothing else to do. The experience was quite bad."
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,bad
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"booked a tent + a place to eat from A to Z but in the end there was still no place to eat with a view as booked + no rice but a plate of noodles cost more than 100k, worthy of 1 star"
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,serving in the rain is boring
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,BAD. Not worth the money.
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"The food is very delicious. Usually grilled food is tough and dry, but here everything is just right, soft, and not salty. Enthusiastic service. Very chill."
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"My experience here with my team of 9 friends was quite disappointing, not as expected.
- There is a private bathroom and toilet but no toilet paper and hand sanitizer
- The breakfast and grilled food are okay, but when we asked the staff to help us clean the breakfast tables because all the tables were quite dusty, the security guard helped us clean the tables, while cleaning, the staff May said to him ""why are you cleaning so carefully""????!!!!
- We had already ordered all the breakfast food the night before, and when we asked in the morning if the breakfast was ready, the staff said that we had to come here to order breakfast, they would just make it, they didn't know anything???!!!! I don't know how May's system works anymore?
- The drinks are terrible and 35~40k/cup is not worth it at all
- The plus point is that the space is quite okay, the sea view is beautiful, you can paddle sup for free, sitting in the beach area is quite chill
- The tents are clean, there are toiletries for each tent"
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"Good service, beautiful scenery, airy, enthusiastic and attentive staff, clean tent, amenities, sup paddling, snail catching, campfire, bathroom and toilet"
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"May camping is great. Cool space. Lovely staff. More beautiful than Seoul, Korea😍😘"
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"Great place to relax, friendly staff, beautiful view, delicious barbecue"
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,too bad some guests play loud music and disturb
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"If I'm only using the barbecue, I'd like to know the price and business hours. It would be nice to have a menu."
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,It's so beautiful
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"Very beautiful and quiet place ♥️ we will come back here again 😍
There is everything you need shower cabins, toilet, dishes, barbecue, tables, chairs.
In the tent there is a fan, socket, towels, disposable set for cleaning teeth, shower gel."
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,Nice view will come back next time
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,More beautiful than expected 10 points no but
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,Bad experience
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"The day I went was during the week. The camping area had very few guests. The guests opposite rented a huge speaker and sang until 12am. At that time, the camping area was on the beach so I was okay with it, but the guests even dragged the speaker into the tent area, as if it was blasting straight into my ears (it was already past 12am).

At 5am, the speaker continued to be turned on. And the tent was opposite that speaker. I have to say that I jumped out of my skin like a bullet exploding 🥲 The camping area didn't even give a warning, it would be fine to turn it on at the beach, but this one turned it on right in the camping area.

Not to mention the price of 760k/standard tent, but the mattress was like an inflated buoy, so it was painful to lie on. One person woke up and the other fell on their back. In addition, there was a power outage in the middle of the night, and there was a small fan that didn't work 🥲 With this price, investing in facilities is more worthy"
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"It's worth the experience. I recommend trying chicken pho, it's great."
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"Beautiful, spacious, clean space.
The tent is fully prepared, neat, has a fan, cool.
The staff is funny and cute"

ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"Ideal for a picnic. Dishes, knives, barbecue, coals - everything is there. Just bring garbage bags, napkins are fine. The staff offers to fry your meat or cut salads, but we refused and cooked ourselves. The territory is clean, well-groomed, quiet. There are tents for overnight stays."
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,Fun and humorous staff

ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,Service is so bad
ChIJQ2NAxw1hcDERKJziQ0sTbFI,"The beach is bad, the staff is enthusiastic but there are too many mistakes, there is no fan in the common dining room. While the guests were eating, the staff poured water on the floor, it looked very dirty, the toilet has no mirror, it smells bad"

ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Cool! Lots of space, different themed recreation areas! Nature!"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Nice lake. Tent + barbecue, coal + SUPs, catamaran, zipline - 400 d per person (we arrived in the evening, so there was a 100 d discount). If you want to get a good night's sleep, then definitely not here))) Loud music until late at night, noisy from 7 am too."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"We were there during the holidays, on Independence Day. There weren't many people. There were enough SUPs, tables and everything. You need to buy a ticket at the entrance. We took 200,000, SUPs, catamarans are included. You need to figure out where to go and other questions yourself. It's a bit disorienting. No one will show you anything. There is no administrator on the territory itself. There are waiters. Wi-Fi works. We communicated through a translator. The SUPs were poorly inflated, but they were changed later. Overall, we liked it. Nature, lake, we had a great rest. You can rent a tent and stay overnight. The territory is very interesting. Gorgeous views."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Arrived at 1pm, waited 45 minutes for the tram to take us up. When we got there, it was raining and we were not allowed to check in. There were not enough chairs to sit and wait. The rain was pouring and we were soaked. At 3pm, we were still not allowed to check in. We asked to check out at 10am tomorrow morning. The staff at the counter just said they didn't know. There were women and children wandering around, not a single staff member was there except the staff at the counter who said they didn't know."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"ZCamp in Nha Trang is a great place for outdoor recreation and sports. It has a modern and comfortable infrastructure: clean territory, comfortable training areas, a swimming pool and a recreation area by the sea. The atmosphere is very friendly, there are many active and positive people.

The staff is friendly and always ready to help, the trainers are professional and motivate you to do sports. I especially liked the combination of fitness, yoga and relaxation on the beach - all in one place.

ZCamp is ideal for those who want to combine relaxation, an active lifestyle and new acquaintances in Nha Trang. 💪🌴☀️"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Beautiful place, but the animals in cages do not look healthy, everything seems old and poorly maintained. Not worth the trip out of Nha Trang in my opinion"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Bad food. Expensive
If you are single, take your girlfriend camping, it's fun, but don't eat here."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"My boyfriend and I arrived with good expectations, but unfortunately, the reality turned out to be far from the photos. The room we got looked completely different: it was uncleaned, sloppy, there was a plant lying on the balcony, the door did not close well. The first impression was a complete disappointment.
The territory itself is pleasant: spacious, with beautiful nature, which somewhat saves the overall impression. But the service leaves much to be desired. The staff did not even try to inform us: no one told us what time the restaurant was open until, what activities and entertainment there were on the territory. In fact, we were simply left to figure it out ourselves.
Another thing - they gave us food, but asked us to cook it ourselves. At the same time, no information or help was provided. For a place that positions itself as cozy and hospitable, the level of service is frankly poor.
Overall: the nature and location are good, but the organization and service need to be urgently improved."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"My friends and I went to Zcamp for a day from afternoon to the next morning
🌿 fun, reasonable price, lots of delicious food
🌿 beautiful, airy view
🌿 lovely, enthusiastic staff
🌿 playing zipline is fun, easy, safe, supported by staff, and playing in the river
💢 everyone should book a room early, I booked late so my house was super hot at noon and early afternoon"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,friendly staff beautiful view check in like
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,Nice place

Daz still said no order yet"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,So awesome
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,He is very enthusiastic and thoughtful.
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,especially recommended for children
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"A great place for barbecue! Barbecue, coal, everything is provided and lit. All you have to do is grill your meat or order dishes and ready-made BBQ sets from the menu.

It is better to arrive in the morning. From 8 to 10, to take the best places for a picnic. But usually there are enough places, usually cafes come here, order a dish and leave soon. But nothing prevents you from spending the whole day here.

We got there by taxi Indrive for 115,000 DNG / 460 rubles, back in the evening - 150,000 DNG.

We chose the option ""1 day of picnic with BBQ"". It includes: barbecue, coal, kindling, grate, dishes; SUPs and catamarans; on the common area there is a pool with small slides and mattresses, a dinosaur world, an airplane and other objects. The price for such a combo: 200,000 DNG / 800 RUB for adults, 100,000 DNG / 400 RUB for children, from 8 to 16. Just an entrance ticket without a barbecue, SUPs and catamarans - 100,000 DNG / 400 RUB. After 16:00 you can fish on the territory from the shore, the places are equipped.

There is tent rental - 50,000 DNG / 200 RUB for 2 hours; rooms - 100,000 DNG for 2 hours. There are different combo options. You can request a full list in the Hall.

The prices are affordable. Very good service, if something is missing, you can ask through a translator (tongs, water, drinks, menu).

I took my own spinning rod. I bought it in a fishing store in the center. You can rent a fishing rod here in Z-camp for 50,000 DNG (±200 RUB) with bait. But it doesn't look serious from the outside. I didn't catch it myself, but I saw how small fish were pulled out on the other side. And I saw a bite. You can take a SUP and swim across the lake, fish on the other side.

We made the shashlik ourselves. We ordered pork neck, onions, vinegar and vegetables the day before the trip in the morning at the Go! supermarket through the app. They brought it after lunch, I paid in cash.

This was our route through Z camp. Watch more about vacations in Vietnam on the channel SUMMER IN GOA letovgoa in the search on YouTube."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Peaceful place, good staff and manager, Should try"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,Okay
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Lots of games, enthusiastic staff"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"My house is near Phuoc Dong so I often go camping in this area on weekends. Now there is a huge inflatable house. The staff is lovely, the manager is enthusiastic in supporting, and the repair is ok."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Going with a group of friends was very fun, thank you very enthusiastic staff. Thanks Tuan and Hiep"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Friendly host, quiet and fresh air. Must experience."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Beautiful, great fishing!"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"I advise everyone to visit this place. Polite staff, natural drinks"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"This is the 3rd time going to Zcamping, the tents and rooms have air conditioning, the view is great, the food is delicious too, family, company, or couples in love, very suitable"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Beautiful lake surrounded by hills. There are SUPs, pedal boats, fishing rods with bait for rent. Liked it."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,Everything ok
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Camping site is very suitable for families and young people. Many interesting activities, spacious space, super airy and cute nv"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,A beautiful camping and resting area on the lake shore among the lush green hills. The magnificent view is absolutely peaceful.
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,Zbs place
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,Pipe!
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Thanks a lot. Spacious tents near the water. The guy who met us was thoughtful and smiling. The registration girl was dear, explained everything and spoke. Coffee with milk and ice is delicious. Thank. Be sure to come back"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Nice place, but in the evening there is a lot of karaoke"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"5* entertainment activities -> For those who like to experience outdoor activities, Z Camp is suitable. Archery, Sup rowing, duck pedaling...
4* hatchery room -> I travel a lot so it's not important for the hatchery room to be beautiful and luxurious. But ZCamp is suitable for me and the equipment (fan, air conditioner, toilet, bed, chair...) is still complete, the room is clean. Each room will give you an extra bottle of water/person. When I first came in, I still had 2 rolls of toilet paper. The view is amazing 🥰 Thank you Tuan for arranging a very satisfactory room.
5* food and drink -> if you choose to stay, you can have breakfast! I woke up late so there is also a restaurant for lunch, the price ranges from 10k-400k, there are also drink stalls along the entertainment area, and a coffee shop to enjoy the view, the price ranges from 30k-50k so tourists don't have to worry about being ripped off. When staying overnight, everyone will also have a BBQ meal per person, and if you want to order more dishes, you need to do it before 8pm, because the kitchen will be closed and no more dishes will be served
Pet welcome 🐱 5* thank you ZCamp for letting us bring pets in, I know it will affect a lot because if the next guest is like that, but the service will still clean everything up before welcoming the next guest. 10 points
10* staff must say that the staff are extremely friendly, dedicated and always happy to serve. The staff only need chairs because there is no need to discuss 🥹"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"We checked in on time. But there was a misunderstanding on the part of the administrator. We had everything inclusive, but they didn’t want to bring us food or meat. They also did not clean up the trash from neighboring vacationers."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,🙌
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Lose, experience more anger"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,Friendly staff and very nice well-groomed area 🥰💫
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Too bad. Memorable experience, I booked a room nearly 10 days in advance but when I checked in, the room was really dirty, the toilet had black mold, the mattress was full of dust and dirt.
When asked to resolve the issue, the manager apologized and was given another room
Rented speakers for 350 but at first I was not told what time I could sing. At 10:30, the staff came up and said they had to turn off the music due to company regulations. Why didn't you say that in the first place? The reminder attitude is also not good
Very bad experience"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,Too bad . From the room to the service staff and the way they talk to customers. Came here and will definitely never come back. What a waste of money
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,The staff is terrible. They don't follow the rules they themselves have announced.
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"A great place to relax from the city noise in 15 minutes from the city noise. Large diverse territory, a magnificent fresh lake surrounded by mountains. There is something to do: SUPs, catamarans, fishing, archery. Stayed overnight in a tent - really liked it! There is a fan and air conditioning in the tent"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,very wasteful service
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Okay, not for resting because at night guests sing karaoke very loudly, changing sleeping place every now and then is fun"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"We just had a very memorable camping trip, the staff here are very enthusiastic, especially the 2 male staff. Always supporting in every situation, from guiding the fun, helping to set up the projector, or having problems while having fun, call 1'30s and they will be there 😆."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"This article is dedicated to thank the zcamp staff for enthusiastically supporting our trip. We stayed at the homestay and stayed overnight to play sup and shoot archery and have BBQ. As for the homestay, I will not rate it highly because the room is okay and will not be suitable for those who value room space, but I appreciate the quality of service of the staff and the scenery here. Luckily, we went on a beautiful day so our group has many pictures to bring back. We went on a weekday so it was not too crowded. Overall, I feel very happy and thank zcamp and the zcamp staff for giving our group a comfortable and wonderful experience beyond expectations."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"This place could be great if it weren't for....
1) Lack of maintenance! As if this place was abandoned! Everything is in mold, branches and trash.
2) Speakers at every step are colossal in size! As if a concert is planned. Instead of privacy and sounds of nature, there is the scream of speakers and people who want to shout them down.
3) 170 dong for entry for two. What is this for? For the two points listed above?
4) A lot of people who leave trash right under their feet.

P.S. The views are magnificent! But it is absolutely impossible to concentrate on them!"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Picturesque place, celebrated New Year here. You can ride catamarans in the form of swans, shoot a bow. There is also a small zoo on the territory. The cafe has Vietnamese food. We ordered rice with egg - not tasty"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Entry ticket costs 50.000 per person. Includes free coffee, but we didn't find the cafe. There's not much to do. The views are great, though. I'm not sure whether it is worth paying."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"It used to be cool here, now... everything is in decline, not cleaned up, not improved, the cafe is expensive like in a Russian airport (a portion of fries was offered for 450 thousand), fishing here... well, just to while away the time, you are unlikely to catch anything.... I do not recommend it..."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,Very cool place with a lake
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"This place may be good for walking, but I don't recommend staying overnight. We got this tent, everything is moldy. The staff did nothing to solve this problem. There is a strong smell of toilet everywhere, it feels like all waste products are being dumped into the lake under the tents. The day after returning from there, my whole family developed a skin disease. It's just a nightmare! The photo is not for the faint of heart!"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,Very cozy and beautiful place near the wonderful lake. There are many locations for making photo and just fir have a good time. Must notice Caffe with very tasty drinks. But when you going here you must bring a repellent. Because mosquitoes in Asia is more dangerous. Be safe ✌🏻
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"It is a cafe restaurant accommodation camping barbecue site next to a lake or a river. The entrance fee is 50,000 won, and the staff will give it to you at the entrance. You can drink a drink at the cafe with that ticket. The iced cafe latte is light and delicious. I visited on Monday lunch, and there was only one group of people, and it was so quiet and the air was fresh, which was nice. It was a place where I wondered why there were no people. It is perfect for leaving the city, taking a walk and quietly looking at the water^^ Highly recommended!!"

ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Our group experienced it on a slightly rainy day but it was super fun. The staff at the Camp were very enthusiastic. The page admin was super cute to talk to. But we booked Mr. Chau to row sup but he hasn't shown up yet 🫠. The food was delicious and there was a lot of it. In short, 9.5 points 😂"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"OPPO Nha Trang team sincerely thanks KDL.
- Beautiful scenery
- Charming nature
- Spacious space
- Enthusiastic support from the staff❤️.
Wishing KDL Zcamp - Ho Kenh Ha to grow more and more"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"It's been a long time since I've been to zcamp, everything has changed a lot. The food and beverage services, including the rooms here, are much better than the last time I went. My group of about 14 people went, everyone felt that this trip was really comfortable and had a lot of fun. 💓
Thank you Binh and the team for supporting us
Everyone, come and experience it together ahhhh 🫶"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,Thanks Binh
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,Binh thank you!
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Thank you Binh for supporting us so much, we will come back thanks"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Cheap, delicious food, will go again if I have the chance, should book in advance"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,Good camping service
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,There are underwater games that need bathrooms and change. Hopefully the services of the tourist area will be more complete for visitors to have the best experience.
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"+Booking: You should book via Zalo or call directly, I chose the Glamtrip website, when filling in the information, someone will text you via Zalo, this website is not very good because it sent me the wrong email, when booking a room, the email said there were no rooms, making me a bit distrustful of the sales person. 
+Parking: There is a parking lot for those who are afraid to enter because the terrain is difficult, narrow and very steep, anyone who buys a ticket is not encouraged to go straight in. 
+Games: There are statue painting, SUP and duck pedaling, there are some sightseeing spots but they are not yet completed, this place seems to have been a state-owned game area. 
+Room: At first, I chose a room with a view of the lake but luckily that direction was the direction of the sunset, entering the room at 3pm was like a dry sauna, even though the staff turned on the air conditioner but the room was still very hot, so hot that the bottle of cold water I brought in a while later became warm water, luckily I was able to change rooms. At night it's completely different, the air conditioner is 24 degrees but it's freezing cold omggg. The blankets and pillows are not clean and soft, when changing rooms, some people forget to put the pillowcases in, they don't scrub the bathroom (the bathroom is the place I'm most bored with) and there's no doormat. 450/person/night is too expensive, the interior has a lot of design ideas but the products used are all low quality. 
+ Food and drink: You can bring your own food but there will be an additional charge for charcoal, spoons, chopsticks, bowls, ice for 150k, and if you don't bring your own, ZCamp has a BBQ set (calculated per person). When you sit down to eat, remember to bring mosquito repellent or spray, otherwise they will kill you. 
+ Staff: Friendly and enthusiastic, but there should be more people to clean the room. 
=> Conclusion: Those are my opinions, I'm saying them so that ZCamp can accept them and change for the better, not to criticize. I tried this place once, but if I come back I'll say no."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Friendly and enthusiastic staff, good service, beautiful scenery 👍"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Great space, very chill, there is Mr. Lam who supports Sup very enthusiastically and happily. And Mr. PV Tuan also supports our group wholeheartedly. Damn!!!"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,Thanks Tuan
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,Ten points. Service okie
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,Zcamp is so wonderful. Highly recommended !
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Fun, nice view"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,It's ok
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,A place to go for an exciting group experience 🥰 The support staff are very enthusiastic and helpful.
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"ZCamp 9.5 points everyone.
The staff are lovely
The air-conditioned tent is ok
Everyone here is very enthusiastic in supporting everyone"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"I went for 2 days 1 night, the view and pictures were beautiful, the service was enthusiastic, the food was delicious. In general, you must go everyone ❤️"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"beautiful scenery
enthusiastic service"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"enthusiastic service, beautiful scenery"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,In Nha Trang but I just found out about this area now. Thank you staff. Very good support. Food is also ok. 5 stars
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,The staff was enthusiastic and cheerful. Thank you Mr. Tuan for supporting the group and taking beautiful photos. I will come back with my family in June.
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,Happy staff good service
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"An ideal place to chill out in the afternoon with your homonyms, grilling BBQ and chatting. The surrounding space is romantic and simple. I came here at noon to rest but encountered a beautiful afternoon scene. I was in a hurry so I didn't have time to take pictures of all the scenes here."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"I have visited this place 2 times, beautiful and relaxing views"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Z Camping, a great choice, my small family had a warm and fun evening. Especially the staff is very enthusiastic, the food is delicious and abundant, the space is airy. If I have a chance, I will continue to visit again"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,too bad
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"From SG, you can rent a room with a bathroom inside
Mostly Nha Trang guests come here for a change of pace
You can bring food, beer and wine, and cook at the campsite. Cool, comfortable air, cool lake water. The staff are friendly and provide maximum support when needed."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"The tent now has air conditioning, suitable for groups and experiences."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Nice aria! Green clean, good service!"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"A great place for events, birthdays, any celebration. Everything is well organized. Yes, it's partially neglected, but I think they'll restore everything eventually.
Excellent sandy beach, SUP rides, and fishing are included in the price 👍
It's best to bring your own food and drinks.
Breakfast is served in the morning: scrambled eggs and banh mi (30 dong), coffee included.
Conveniently located, just 10 km from the city."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"10 points is not available but always 🥰
Enjoyed playing, delicious food, very cute staff.
My dad didn't dare to row sup so the staff rowed him around to experience ☺️
Thank you for giving me a wonderful vacation with friends and family ❤️"
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,too bad... asked clearly about the services in advance to make sure... when they arrived they said there was none... blatant fraud
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"An excellent location for a 2-day holiday away from the city. SUB riding, fishing and natural beauty."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"The scenery is beautiful but you should only come to visit. You have to think carefully about staying because whether you stay in a homestay or a normal hostel, you have to go to the public toilet quite far. The food service is not very satisfying."
ChIJD04_3RhfcDERwuqnYm_RTRg,"Cool place. Lake, hills, saps."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,There's absolutely nothing to do. It's better to buy 20 bottles of beer than to come here. It's complete devastation and boredom.
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Pool is bust but still great. 50 k ticket
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"There are no people, everything is broken, it is not worth wasting time visiting this place"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Beautiful park with good walking and cycling routes. We took a pedal boat trip on the lake, it was nice. Highly recommended"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Fierce game
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"On the date of 21.07.25, the entrance fee for one person was 100,000 dongs. Without additional entertainment (catamarans, swimming pool, children's area, etc.), just a walk
I think that the price is too high for this establishment, it is better to go to Fairy Forest, there you will have fun for 50,000 dongs per person
We walked around the park alone, there were no other people at all, it seemed like an abandoned place. Everything looks sad, outdated, the place needs major repairs
But if a decent businessman takes over this place, there is every chance that the place will come to life, since it has a good prospect, the lake itself is clean, and the idea is good"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"I just came to shoot the location, the reviews below said 50k per person and then you choose what you need for an additional price. Now there is such a price list, I did not need the services, and they did not let me shoot the location either ("
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Overall, it's interesting to come here just for the views, but otherwise, it's completely abandoned. It's unclear how anyone could live there; you could die of boredom. We wanted to go on a catamaran ride, but we couldn't find anyone to book. I wouldn't eat there, it's scary. The animals seem to be well-cared for. I feel sorry for the turtle living in its small, empty metal cage. Admission is 50,000 dong, which includes a drink. It's a one-time stay."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"I honestly don't understand why the ratings are so high.
1. The grounds are unkempt.
2. Everything is terribly neglected, with trash everywhere where flower pots should be, cigarette butts and bottles are strewn about.
3. The poor animals are in cages, with dead rabbits that were apparently recently born, along with the larger rabbits. It stinks.
4. The photo areas are shabby, if you can call them that.
My impressions are only negative!!! Perhaps due to a lack of funds. I can imagine what could have been done with this place, but now it's a complete mess!!!"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Seriously degraded.
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"A very nice place, beautiful mountains, the lake is very warm, there are many beautiful photos, there are playgrounds, lots of swings, tents with air conditioning, SUPs, catamarans, a swimming pool, I highly recommend it, an interesting place, lots of vegetation and flowers."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Nice view
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Paying 80k for a lake... Are you serious? The location is not worth the money.
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"A real recreation center. About 20 years ago it was probably great here, but now it's clear that they don't take care of it very well. We came to watch the birds and take a walk in nature - that's what we got) Otherwise, nothing out of the ordinary was discovered."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"We liked it) A quiet park with a view of the lake and mountains, there is a restaurant and a coffee shop🥰
Entrance 80,000 dong, the price includes a drink"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Tired, seen-it-all park. Not very well-kept, okay if you have absolutely nothing to do. You can ride a sap on a green lake. There is a campsite, but when there are locals - it is noisy."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Beautiful scenery but little investment. Quite messy. Reasonable price. Suitable for budget travel.
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"A very quiet, peaceful place where you can eat and admire the views."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"This place is so nice! If you're near here I highly recommend checking it out!!! ☺️ Everything is so cheap and we only spent 200,000 to use the kayak all day 😁 entry was 50,000 and that includes a free drink, totally worth it I highly recommend it 😉"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Not well maintained, not neat, I didn't want to go there for free, but here they charge 50 dong, well I hope it goes to feed the animals (they are there)
There was an interesting picture, we were walking, we saw a ram lying around (it was still alive), we went and told about it, so what do you think they did? A couple of minutes later they just cut it up😂"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Dong Bo Revolutionary Base
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"They're demanding 50,000 dong, and I don't know what for. And they won't let me ride my bike, so I didn't get in. It's not that I'm sorry for the money, it's just that I don't know what I'm paying for."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Not a bad place...but the fishing was not successful...we sat there for 2 hours and didn't catch anything
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Cool, nice view"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"A place to change the wind near Nha Trang, cool lake view, about 20 minutes by motorbike from the center, suitable for weekend picnics"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Enthusiastic staff
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Food is not diverse
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Local tourist center for recreation in tents, large territory, beautiful in pictures, in fact dirty and devastated, swimming pools do not work, there is a trampoline and catamarans on the lake!"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Very bad experience. Old rooms. Spent money booking air-conditioned room. Air-conditioned not cold. Very hot. Unprofessional service. Nothing to do. Water is expensive. Went once, never again. Spent money and got frustrated."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"The room is old, the wooden floor is not soundproof, at night when we were sleeping, people walked around and made noise, disturbing us, even trying to break the door to open our room. It felt unsafe to stay.
The landscape should be renovated and repainted to attract more guests.
In general, it is degraded. The experience is terrible, not enjoyable.
Besides, the staff is only enthusiastic!"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"enthusiastic staff, had overnight camping but no security guard, food not very good but nice view and cheap"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"1. The view is nothing, everything is old and dilapidated
2. The swimming pool is like a fish pond
3. The waterfall has no water
4. The ticket price is high compared to the quality
5. The attitude of the staff at the restaurant: 1/10 - arrogant attitude, very disrespectful to customers (especially customers using combos), no advice for customers
6. The food is not delicious, the rice is undercooked,
7. The floating restaurant manager does not keep his word"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"A sad abandoned place for 80 d per person, there is absolutely nothing to do here
We came in vain"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,all kinds of surcharges
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Sorry, but I don't understand what I have to pay for... Paying money just to look at the lake or spend time on the shore of the reservoir is very strange 🤔

ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Delicious food, nice view, friendly staff. 10 points"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"A sad place, poor animals. Now, as far as I understand, it is in the process of renovation. If you only come for the photo. Entrance 80. I especially feel sorry for the snake; keeping it in such conditions should be a criminal offense."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Spacious, airy space, many beautiful scenes for selfies.
The resort also has many dining services, play areas and swimming pools for children.
There is a private campsite. Very suitable for picnics and team building
The restaurant is close to the lake so it is cool all day, the lake surface is clear and beautiful. It's like a miniature Da Lat"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,This tourist area is so boring. There is nothing to do or see.
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"This place is cool, suitable for family weekends for children to play or organize group gatherings.
I went early in the week so it wasn't crowded, you can choose any hut to sit."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Beautiful lake view, delicious and varied food at the restaurant. The kids love the painting area, sand shoveling, and taking pictures of dinosaurs... There is a free swimming pool for kids, which is great."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Spacious space, suitable for families with small children, full of experience services from fishing, painting statues, duck pedaling, visiting and checking in in the countryside style - healing and healing - has a restaurant for lunch with a variety of dishes - suitable for your family's taste"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"I come to Ho every holiday with my family, but recently I see that Ho is doing very well in terms of scenery and service. The restaurant has a variety of dishes, reasonable prices. 5 stars!!!"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,I ‘ve never been there before. I was impressive by the atmosphere and all the views. Everything is being rebuilt. It will be better in the near future. Deserve to visit once for foreign tourist. Love Galina Lakeview ❤️
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Million dollar view, beautiful scenery, poetic, romantic, virtual life, raise your phone to take beautiful pictures. Delicious food, play area for children, mini zoo for children to experience"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"The second time my family visited Ho Kenh Ha
This time there was more space for the kids to play - the whole family sat and ate comfortably in the restaurant.
Families who like to sit in huts can sit separately.
The food was delicious, especially the fish hotpot, fresh and fragrant
Worth a third visit 👍"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,The fish aren't biting. There's nothing to do. It's a dump. I don't recommend it.
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Beautiful, cool"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Enthusiastic and friendly staff. The scenery is as advertised. However, the quality of breakfast is too bad (specifically, the breakfast bread is too soft, eaten stale bread from the day before, even though the tourist area is right in a residential area)."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"I have been here 3 times, using the food and pedal boat service is very interesting. Beautiful scenery, many virtual living angles."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Not so great, a lot of it broken and neglected."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,There isn't anything fun. The map is missing some detail.
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"A family-friendly place, surrounded by nature around a lake with flower-filled walking trails, a bit kitschy. Numerous straw huts are well-distributed for meals. However, the food served isn't always great. However, the staff is very attentive and responsive."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"There's absolutely nothing to do here.
I don't recommend it."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Nice view
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Horrible place. Long abandoned. Don't waste your time and money!
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"The space is large, there are many beautiful scenes to take pictures. The resort also has many dining and resort services. In the tourist area, there is the historical relic of Dong Bo Revolutionary Base. Entrance ticket is 80k.

ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Cool place you can walk and ride in pairs those photos that I posted first I was wrong and these photos are about this place
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,The scenery is still wild. The playground is not complete. The food comes out a bit slow.
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"We came fishing, there was a dump on the shore, the fish were small, and they let everyone go. Even the Vietnamese guy with the fishing gear didn't catch any, and they promised piranhas and catfish. I'll be laughing for a long time at how much I trusted him. The noisy locals scared away the last fish. They gave us bamboo poles for fishing rods 🤦🏻‍♀️. Lunch and beer were also included, but I didn't want anything but water, no, I wanted... to run away from there."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Spacious, airy but rundown space"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Million dollar view, beautiful scenery, poetic, romantic like Da Lat. Great virtual check-in spot"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Poor service, customers buy tickets the same way, order drinks but they don't have them yet they still make excuses that the resting seats are booked. I give up on you guys😑"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Mainly for young people camping, little scenery, not many games. No electric cars so it is very tiring for the elderly to travel because of the many slopes."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,The facilities are good and I like it~
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Poor service, spacious but boring with nothing to do. The space is messy, as if everything is just placed there to fill it up. The staff is arrogant, has an attitude, doesn't respect customers, makes people wait a long time as if it's natural. The food is little and expensive. Go once and you'll never come back."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"like a pile of junk, ruins"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Many beautiful scenes for photography
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"The restaurant is so perfect. Duck riding 100k/4 people, hammock rental, delicious food"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Beautiful scenery and affordable service fees
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,How can you play the old road without money 64k like the picture in 2023?
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Over-advertising, lack of service. Swimming pool repaired for nearly 2 years"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"An incredibly beautiful place 😍
We'll definitely come back, but this time to stay overnight in a tent or a room. The atmosphere is captivating, and every spot is beautiful 🤍"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Entrance ticket 80k, the constructions are not yet completed, the scenery is pristine, but there is still no special feature to attract visitors, there are no incentives for guests to book hotel stays when visiting."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"The entrance fee is 80k, there's nothing to do and nothing special to see....in general, I just go to see but won't come back....bye"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"The staff's attitude is too bad. The entrance fee and food are quite expensive and not delicious, but not much to discuss. The receptionist gave wrong advice to customers. From the beginning, they said the ticket included sup rowing, but when they got to rowing, the staff didn't care even though they clearly told the receptionist like that. The working attitude is unprofessional, they gathered in groups of 5 or 7, whispering and looking at customers. Very bad experience."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Interesting place! Lots of beautiful places for photos)))). There is a camping with SUP boards. Lots of cafes with beautiful views. We had to try hard to get there, the vigilant security guard didn't want to let us in because it was ""closed"", but on the third try and with the arrival of the administrator we managed."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"The place is beautiful and the idea is good, but many places in the park are abandoned and difficult to approach, and again, providing karaoke services for local residents scares off foreign tourists, since not everyone likes the screams of people without a voice and hearing. When the park is restored and the construction of everything planned is finished, perhaps there will be more guests. At the moment, I will not recommend this place for visiting."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"-My family went with 5 adults and 5 children and arrived at this location around 10am.

-The entrance fee for adults is 50k, children 25k
- The space has lots of trees and is near the lake so it's cool.

- There is a separate camping area
- The path has many miniatures for taking virtual photos, but some areas are stopping so you can explore the whole area after going around.

- The food is average, the price is high compared to the quality. The waiting time for food is a bit long.

- The dining area has a small area for children to play"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Camped here with a group of 10 people. we stayed only one night. It was great! The tent is alright. You’re basically sleeping on the floor on a skid. There was a fire lit at 9pm and the clean up crew started cleaning the tables in front of the tents at 6am. The place had a shower and washroom. The washroom was super dirty and the shower was useable. Did not even accept the toilet. The water is fresh water and has lots of fish. The water was warm. They blasted music pretty early around 7-8am. Checkout was at 10pm.
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"It's very beautiful. You can sail out to the bay on a submersible and fish in silence, surrounded by the sounds of nature."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Nice view, spacious, many places to take pictures, BUT FOOD TAKES TOO LONG, WAIT 1 HOUR FOR 2 DISHES, HAVE TO WAIT FOR CHOPSTICKS AGAIN. Not a very enjoyable experience. Food is too expensive."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,The attitude and way of speaking of the security guard (parking guard) is disrespectful to the guests!
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"- Entrance fee for adults is 50k, children are 25k
- Large space, but it is not finished yet so it is more chaotic, there are many places for everyone to take pictures, the location is right next to the lake so it is cool all day, the lake surface is very beautiful.
- Poor management, the dining table from night to noon the next day is still not cleaned.
- The camping space is quite interesting, each tent is separate but the tents are close together, you can come to camp and eat food at the resort (price is about 500k/person) or bring your own food to cook and rent a private tent (350k/tent)
- On weekends, there are many guests so the restaurant takes a while to serve food, the staff is cute to talk to guests. Karaoke speakers are available for rent"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Here I have very funny photos with my friends, however this place is more suitable for checking in beautiful scenery than relaxing."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Very cool, lots of trees, nice view, even camping. The resort has many attractions but most of them are abandoned or under construction."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Delicious food, great view"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"A nice big park for walks. Of course, not in the heat. Although there is a small pool, showers. Lots of places for beautiful photos.
You have to watch your step carefully, so as not to step on some creepy crawly thing.
You shouldn't climb the old wooden stairs, some of the steps have rotted and you can fall through.
The installations are certainly tired of time and climate. But the nature itself is very beautiful."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"It's very quiet and beautiful here, a good place to relax from the city suite ☺️. I recommend taking a sightseeing boat tour. Enjoy the beautiful views of the mountains. 🏞😍🧩"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Beautiful location
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"The food was bad, the boiled vegetables were fishy. The view was okay but the culinary experience was terrible."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Lovely place for camping with amazing nature right to the lake. Love it!
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Very nice, worth a visit"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Good place
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"The decoration and design are quite beautiful and eye-catching. Many places to take photos and check-in. The food is delicious and very cheap. But there is a lot of construction, artificial, there are many construction sites that are not finished or left unfinished without maintenance."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Very dirty
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"This place is complete trash, don't go there.
It's a pigsty."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Too many customers, no place to sit for lunch."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Beautiful place for a get away from the daily busy life. Highly recommended
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Good service, beautiful scenery, satisfied"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Spacious. Lots of experiences.
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Although crowded, the restaurant has professional service, very satisfied."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,The scenery is pristine and beautiful but the service price is too high 3*
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"12/1/2021 I booked a room for a lunch break, unfortunately the day before it rained heavily in Nha Trang, so the day I checked in there was a power outage, I felt a bit down. But the good thing is that the staff, the manager, and even the person who booked me all supported me very enthusiastically, resolved my complaints very well, and even refunded my room fee. Personally, I really like the service here, I hope I will have the opportunity to come back to experience better service 🥰"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"It's so cool to check in at Galina Lake View, with the immense lake space, kapak rowing is my favorite."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"A beautiful park for recreation, for every taste"
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,The entrance fee is not fair. It should be free if you come in to eat or drink.
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Pretty
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,I don't see any restaurant staff. I want to eat but there's no one. So tiring. But the view is great. Nice pictures.
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"It is located outside the city in a mountainous area with a lake. You can ride a catamaran on the lake. Walk around the territory with many installations. The territory itself is large, you can stay there all day and not get bored. You can take food with you, there are places equipped for a cafe, where you can have a picnic. Children are interested in having fun surrounded by various installations, including a train made of wood at a height, in the mountains. We liked it. We were there several times."
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Swim. Rest. Relax. Peaceful. Quiet. Great.
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,Places to visit when coming to Nha Trang
ChIJGzNN7gNfcDERCWb4EAUbJBo,"Beautiful location, airy, reasonable entrance fee (50,000 VND), beautiful scenery suitable for those who like taking photos. There is a lake for fishing, boating, duck pedaling... There are many interesting activities organized under the lake. Very suitable for picnics, taking photos, team building... The price at the restaurant is ok compared to the general level. The staff is enthusiastic and cheerful. (I went in January 2021)"

ChIJ5fB8rCGpmDER4FAJ_V3quWE,"We took the tour where we released baby turtles and snorkeled. Despite the somewhat poor weather, it was fantastic! Our guide took excellent care of us and provided lots of interesting information. Her English is also excellent. Highly recommended!"
ChIJ5fB8rCGpmDER4FAJ_V3quWE,"The turtle tour was really amazing. The guide who went with me was kind and explained everything in detail.
I saw turtles laying eggs... It was really amazing and touching.
I recommend you try it if you go to Con Dao."

ChIJ5fB8rCGpmDER4FAJ_V3quWE,We had a fantastic snorkelling trip to Hòn Bảy Cạnh guided by Van. Highly recommended!
ChIJ5fB8rCGpmDER4FAJ_V3quWE,"It's a bit of a bland course, but the tours on this island are all about turtle release, snorkeling, and fishing."
ChIJ5fB8rCGpmDER4FAJ_V3quWE,
ChIJ5fB8rCGpmDER4FAJ_V3quWE,"I was told there was nothing here, but there are a few tourist spots, a small market, and a night market. It's quiet and rich in nature. The sea is a beautiful blue, the beach is well-maintained, and there is not a single piece of trash on the ground.
However, prices here are very high compared to where I live in the countryside in Vietnam (Hue). I wonder if they are tourist prices."
ChIJ5fB8rCGpmDER4FAJ_V3quWE,"Very beautiful landscapes, like the rest of this beautiful island."
ChIJ5fB8rCGpmDER4FAJ_V3quWE,"Lovely place, good drink
If you want to snorkel or freedive, it is an ideal destination that might help you to explore the island"
ChIJ5fB8rCGpmDER4FAJ_V3quWE,
ChIJ5fB8rCGpmDER4FAJ_V3quWE,Excessive prices compared to the service provided. Surprised by the manager's completely unprofessional attitude when it came to paying at the end of the excursion. That speaks volumes. Try other agencies if you have the opportunity.
ChIJ5fB8rCGpmDER4FAJ_V3quWE,
ChIJ5fB8rCGpmDER4FAJ_V3quWE,
ChIJ5fB8rCGpmDER4FAJ_V3quWE,"We arranged a local tour for 900,000 VND/person that included watching baby sea turtles being released back into the sea and snorkeling from 7:00-10:00. Even though we arrived around 7pm the day before, they were very helpful and able to assist us in English.
The speedboat was clean and comfortable. First, we went to Bay Can Island to see the baby sea turtles, then to the beach on Hong Chau Island. We snorkeled, while everyone else relaxed on the beach. Next, we all snorkeled at the snorkeling spot off the coast of Bay Can Island, which we had visited first, before heading back. It was a short but very satisfying local tour."

ChIJ5fB8rCGpmDER4FAJ_V3quWE,"Although the communication with Ms. Van, a Vietnamese, was in English, they arranged air tickets, hotel arrangements, boat snorkeling, sea turtle egg-laying and release, trekking to the lighthouse, and other tours that allow you to enjoy the great outdoors of Con Dao!

In 2019, they opened a mini hotel with about 10 rooms next to their office, which reflects the high sense of style of the sisters. It is within walking distance of the market and delicious seafood restaurants. There is a shared kitchen on the open terrace, clean rooms, hot showers with good water flow, and a pick-up from the airport for 50,000 VND if requested in advance, as well as a rental motorbike for 120,000 VND."

ChIJ5fB8rCGpmDER4FAJ_V3quWE,"I visited the shop and applied for a day trip snorkeling tour to Bay Canh Island. The woman was fluent in English, which was helpful. The price of each tour depends on the number of participants. I think the prices of other travel agencies are similar. Since three people happened to apply first, we participated as a couple and it was $46 per person, but one more person joined, so it ended up being $42 per person. The flow was snorkeling → lunch at Canh Island → return to Con Son, and I thoroughly enjoyed it."

ChIJm-0iYiapmDERJPfeu1tbLfs,"🇻🇳🌊 Con Dao – Epic in the middle of the ocean 🌊🇻🇳

In the middle of the Southern sea and sky, Con Dao is as beautiful as a green gem, but it is also a place filled with the pain and loss of the nation. From 1862, that is, just 4 years after the French colonialists opened fire to attack Da Nang port until April 1975, the French colonialists and then the American imperialists built the notorious prison system: Phu Hai, Phu Tuong, Chuong Cop, Chuong Bo… – “hell on earth” with all kinds of brutal torture.

However, the darkest place shines with immortal will. The communist soldiers, the patriots wrote an epic with their steadfast will and indomitable spirit, so that today the Fatherland is independent and the people are free, prosperous and happy.

More than 20,000 people have fallen on this beautiful island, but currently Hang Duong cemetery has only collected nearly 2,000 graves, many of which are: ""Unknown martyrs"". 

Before each incense stick, each tombstone, we feel so small and our hearts suddenly rise with infinite gratitude. 

During the days when the whole country joyfully celebrates the 80th anniversary of National Day (1945–2025), visiting Con Dao Special Zone, known as the “Altar of the Fatherland”, bowing to commemorate and pay tribute to generations of ancestors, we can see that peace is truly beautiful and precious - living, studying, working, and contributing in an independent and free environment is truly happy...

Let me borrow the words of the poem “Singing on Con Dao Hell” by Phung Quan to conclude my feelings:

“Is there any place on this earth
Where when you step foot there
We suddenly become small
Before the great soul of the people…”

🙏 Paying tribute to generations of ancestors - those who have fallen for the eternal existence of the Fatherland.

It's said to have been used as a prison since the French colonial era, but as I explored, I realized it was also used to house political prisoners during the Vietnam War.

The narrow cells, the dark cells, the tiger cages, the cow cages... all recreated in the most realistic way the hellish life that prisoners had to go through. Each story, each artifact here is a powerful testament to the brutality of the colonial regime and at the same time a praise for the indomitable will of the patriotic Vietnamese people. Con Dao Prison is not only a historical evidence but also a valuable lesson about sacrifice, patriotism and the desire for freedom.

ChIJm-0iYiapmDERJPfeu1tbLfs,"Notes when visiting Con Dao Prison:
1. Buy tickets at the Museum, there are 2 forms of buying directly at the counter or scanning the code to buy online
2. When there is a tour guide, learning and exploring will be much more meaningful. If anyone goes for the first time, it is highly recommended to choose a time with a tour guide, or arrive 15-20 minutes earlier than that time to thoroughly visit the museum, because the tour guide will not be able to talk in detail about every small detail at the museum
3. The points/clusters including the museum, tiger cage, and prison are quite far from each other. It is recommended to travel by private means (limit taking taxis because they are not proactive). After the tour guide finishes narrating at one point, they will also travel by motorbike to another point to continue guiding and telling stories to everyone.
4. It is highly recommended to bring water, wear shoes, wear a hat and wear sunscreen. If you listen to the tour guide from beginning to end, it will be about 2 hours. Outdoor sightseeing time also takes up about half, so everyone should prepare the above items."

With its classic French architecture, airy space and large grounds, the Island Lord's Palace is both a symbol of power at one time and a living testament to the brutal prison regime. Today, this place is preserved as a special historical relic, displaying many valuable documents and artifacts to help visitors better understand the painful but heroic past of the nation.

Walking through the rooms, I could almost feel the presence of the people who lived and worked there. It made me think deeply about the island's past and the lives that were touched by this place. The exhibits are presented in a way that's easy to understand, and they really helped me connect with the human stories behind the history books.

What struck me most wasn't just the facts and figures, but the quiet dignity of the palace itself. It stands as a silent witness to a significant period, and being there evoked a sense of both sadness and respect.

It's hard to put into words exactly how this place made me feel. It wasn't just about seeing old furniture or reading information panels. It was more about the atmosphere, the sense of history hanging in the air, and the quiet reminder of the human experiences that shaped this island.

If you visit Con Dao, please make time for the Island Chief Palace. It's more than just a historical site; it's a place that will stay with you long after you leave. It's a chance to connect with the past on a personal level and truly understand a piece of this island's soul. I left feeling moved and with a deeper appreciation for the stories Con Dao holds."

Each place can be visited in 15-20 minutes. The reconstruction is not too highlighted, it is more a matter of honoring the memory of the country than a real historical quest."

Con Dao Museum is a place to preserve and display thousands of valuable artifacts and documents about the history of formation, struggle and development of Con Dao. This place realistically recreates the fierce period of Con Dao prison - ""hell on earth"" - along with tragic stories about the indomitable spirit of revolutionary soldiers.

⸻

2. Brief and concise introduction

Con Dao Museum is a red address marking the heroic history of the nation's struggle, where visitors can learn about ""hell on earth"" and the steadfastness of tens of thousands of political prisoners. This is a meaningful destination for the journey back to the source.

⸻

3. Introduction for tourism - experience

Coming to Con Dao Museum, visitors will experience a modern exhibition space, admire artifacts, vivid images of Con Dao prison, the life of island residents and heroic feats. This is a place not only to pay tribute to history but also to understand more deeply the value of peace and freedom today."
ChIJ04ihAyepmDERoqNB8kdV66Y,"You must definitely go when you come to Con Dao. To know the history of 113 years of enemy rule that took the blood and bones of our ancestors and not our homeland. We integrate internationally and are friends with other countries, but don't forget history."

ChIJ04ihAyepmDERoqNB8kdV66Y,Remember to ask for the tour guide's schedule to buy tickets for the 5-location tour. The tour will start from Con Dao Museum and will move to the remaining 4 locations.

ChIJ04ihAyepmDERoqNB8kdV66Y,
ChIJ04ihAyepmDERoqNB8kdV66Y,Con Dao Museum is a place to preserve the indomitable resilience of many generations of fathers who sacrificed for national independence. The ticket price is 50k but you can visit all the relics on the island.
ChIJ04ihAyepmDERoqNB8kdV66Y,
ChIJ04ihAyepmDERoqNB8kdV66Y,"The museum... appears to be the Con Dao History Museum... It's said to have existed since the French colonial period, but it seems to mainly focus on the Vietnam War, which is a bit disappointing. If you purchase a ticket, you can also visit the prison next door."
ChIJ04ihAyepmDERoqNB8kdV66Y,"A place that stores information and history of Con Dao. Buying a one-time ticket includes 5 surrounding attractions, everyone should visit all 5 places!"
ChIJ04ihAyepmDERoqNB8kdV66Y,"Buy a 50K ticket to visit many places. I don't know, go to the prison first to buy a ticket, then visit the museum and have to buy it again, so it's 2 times"

The ticket price includes a ticket to the museum as well as to all other places, such as the island governor's villa and prisons. The ticket price for one adult is 50k dong."
ChIJ04ihAyepmDERoqNB8kdV66Y,Everyone should refer to the visiting hours to have a tour guide (which will provide a lot of historical knowledge of our ancestors).
ChIJ04ihAyepmDERoqNB8kdV66Y,"Must visit if you are in Con Dao island. Learned about history of Viet Nam, of Côn Đảo."

ChIJ04ihAyepmDERoqNB8kdV66Y,"A place I think is really worth visiting when coming to Con Dao. The museum condenses all the information about the geography and history of Con Dao, as well as the stories of the political prisoners' resilience against the brutal rule of the colonial governments. The ticket price of 50,000 includes an explanation (according to a fixed schedule) for the cluster of 5 relics including the Museum, the cluster of 3 prisons and the Island Lord's House."
ChIJ04ihAyepmDERoqNB8kdV66Y,"Con Dao Museum started construction on December 6, 2009 and was completed on October 10, 2010, as one of the key projects to celebrate the 1000th anniversary of Thang Long - Hanoi. In 2013, the museum officially opened to visitors, meeting the expectations of the people of the whole country as well as the people of Con Dao district. At the same time, this place is also a space to preserve sacred relics associated with former political prisoners of Con Dao during the period of fighting against colonialism and imperialism in the land once known as ""hell on earth"". 

Located on Nguyen Hue Street, near the French Tiger Cage relic, Con Dao Museum is located on a campus of more than 2 hectares, with a total construction area of 3,570m² and an exhibition space of 1,700m². 

Currently, the museum preserves and displays more than 2,000 valuable documents and artifacts. When visiting, visitors will have the opportunity to learn deeply about the nature and people of Con Dao from prehistoric and early historical times to the current development stage. At the same time, the museum also authentically recreates the history of the resilient struggle of revolutionary soldiers in the Con Dao prison system - a place once known as ""hell on earth"" due to brutal torture and harsh detention conditions."

The tour guide talked about the prisons, the 914 bridge, how cruel the island lord was, and a lot of real information about the Vietnam War. It was really interesting and useful. Adults should also bring children over 14 years old so that they can understand the history and brutality of the war."
ChIJ04ihAyepmDERoqNB8kdV66Y,"I went at 2pm, there was an explanation from the museum. The ticket price was quite cheap, only a few dozen but you could visit all the historical sites."

The artifacts are displayed scientifically, combined with detailed images and annotations, helping me easily visualize and understand more clearly what happened. Con Dao Museum is not only a treasure trove of knowledge but also a profound reminder of the painful but also heroic past of the nation.

Con Dao prison relic area is a special national relic site, a place marking the indomitable tradition of struggle of Vietnamese heroes, soldiers and patriots during 113 years of fighting against French colonialism and American imperialism by the Vietnamese people.
Construction of Con Dao Museum began on December 6, 2009, with support from the Party Committee, government, and people of Hanoi city along with the People's Committee of Ba Ria - Vung Tau province, completed on October 10, 2010 as one of the works to celebrate the 1000th anniversary of Thang Long - Hanoi.

ChIJ04ihAyepmDERoqNB8kdV66Y,"Visiting the Côn Đảo Museum wasn't just looking at old things in glass cases. It was a deeply moving experience that really touched my heart. Even now, thinking about it brings back a wave of emotions.

This island has a heavy history, and the museum does an incredible job of telling the stories of the people who suffered here. It's not always easy to see, but it's so important. As I walked through the exhibits, I felt a real connection to the past. I saw photos and read accounts of the prisoners, their struggles, and their resilience. It wasn't just facts and dates; it felt like I was getting a glimpse into their lives, their hopes, and their pain.

There were moments that genuinely made me feel sad and even a bit angry at the injustice they faced. But there were also stories of incredible strength and the human spirit that shone through even in the darkest times. I left feeling a profound sense of respect for those who endured so much on this island.

The museum itself is well-organized and easy to follow. The information is presented clearly, and there are enough visuals to help you understand the context. It's not overwhelming, and you can take your time to absorb everything.

For me, visiting the Côn Đảo Museum wasn't just a tourist activity. It was a powerful and personal journey into a significant part of history. It helped me understand the weight of the past and appreciate the sacrifices made. If you come to Côn Đảo, please make time for this museum. It's an essential experience that will stay with you long after you leave. It's a place that makes you think, feel, and remember."

When an international human rights monitoring team came, the prison guards led them to this vegetable garden and said that the prisoners were allowed to grow vegetables to improve their meals. This was one of the prison guards' thousands of tricks to deal with public opinion. In reality, behind this vegetable garden was a tiger cage-style prison system with extremely brutal detention cells and torture chambers."

The sadness, brutality and inhumanity still exists in the buildings. This is a sad wake up call to human cruelty and sadly. We don't seem to ever learn ....."
ChIJZ3HnXyapmDEROjRcNB3FkRo,"Tiger Cages is the name given by prisoners to the disciplinary area, built in 1940. Area: 5,477m2, including 2 areas, each area has 60 rooms, above is a solid iron bar and a corridor for guards to control the prisoners. Opposite are 60 roofless rooms arranged in 4 rows, interspersed with 2 rows of Tiger Cages called ""Sunbathing Rooms"". Tiger Cages has no main gate, only a small path leading to Banh III (Phu Tuong camp) and Banh III (Phu Tho camp). These paths are often promptly hidden when there is news of a group of strange visitors coming to Con Dao. In 1962-1963, the US puppet built an additional Camp 5 to shield the front and also had a small path leading to Tiger Cages. Often, prisoners were beaten unconscious when being brought into the Tiger Cage, or when transferring prisoners from one prison to another, the prison guards used batons to press on the prisoners' heads, forcing them to walk silently without looking back or looking elsewhere. This made the prisoners disoriented, not knowing which prison they were being held in.

At the Tiger Cage, prisoners were never at peace, at any time there were prying eyes of the prison guards, at any time they could be beaten, sprayed with lime powder... However, the Tiger Cage was the soul in the struggle to protect the integrity of Con Dao political prisoners, associated with the feats of the anti-secession and anti-flag salute movements, associated with the name ""Old Man of the Tiger Cage"". Cao Van Ngoc, Luu Chi Hieu, and the five victorious stars Nguyen Duc Thuan, Phan Trong Binh, Pham Quoc Sac, Nguyen Minh, Le Van Mot and many other steadfast and indomitable examples of protecting the integrity at the Tiger Cage.

In 1969, the Saigon puppet government exiled 342 female prisoners and 2 children to Con Dao Tiger Cages. Taking advantage of the physiological characteristics of women to exile them, the prison guards repeatedly used lime powder and sharp copper-covered poles... The worst punishment was not being given water to bathe, not being given a toilet... Despite the internal regulations, female prisoners fought continuously from low to high...
It can be said that from the end of 1969 to the beginning of 1970, the female prisoners of Con Dao Tiger Cages were the bravest and most determined flag, making the enemy afraid, contributing to the encouragement of the whole island.
In 1970, from the Tiger Cages, 5 students were returned to Saigon, they denounced the Con Dao Tiger Cages regime. In July 1970, a delegation of American congressmen led by TomHarsKins and journalist Donlux went to Con Dao, discovered the Tiger Cages and witnessed with their own eyes the torture and torture of prisoners there. Among them were women, very young students, even monks and a 60-year-old woman who was blind in both eyes... In mid-July 1970, the news: ""The Con Son Tiger Cages have been exposed..."" was published in newspapers at home and abroad. In response to that public opinion, the Saigon puppet government was forced to demolish the Con Dao Tiger Cages.
The Tiger Cages were built by the French colonialists, but the Tiger Cages were a fierce and horrifying battlefield that made the world angry, only really starting from the tactics of denouncing communism during the US-puppet era.

On April 29, 1979, the French Tiger Cage relic was specially recognized as a National Special Monument by the Ministry of Culture and Information under Decision No. 54-VHTT.QD. On May 10, 2012, the Prime Minister signed Decision No. 548/QD-TTg to rank it as a Special National Monument."

ChIJZ3HnXyapmDEROjRcNB3FkRo,"Go to know and understand the cruelty of France and America, they brutally tortured revolutionary soldiers, to see the indomitable will of our ancestors."
ChIJZ3HnXyapmDEROjRcNB3FkRo,"Visiting Trại Phú Tường, also known as the French Tiger Cages, in Con Dao was an experience that went far beyond just seeing a historical site. It wasn't easy, and it definitely stirred up a lot of emotions, but it's a place I believe everyone should try to understand.

Walking through those narrow, dark corridors and seeing the small, airless cells where so many Vietnamese people were unjustly imprisoned and suffered unimaginable cruelty hit me hard. You can feel the weight of history in the very air. It's impossible to imagine the physical and mental anguish endured within those stone walls.

What struck me most wasn't just the harshness of the conditions, but the resilience of the human spirit that must have existed within those confines. Knowing that people fought for their beliefs and for the freedom of their country within those terrible cages is both heartbreaking and deeply inspiring.

It wasn't a cheerful visit, of course. There were moments I felt a knot in my stomach and tears welling up. It's a stark reminder of the darkness that humans are capable of, but also a testament to the strength and sacrifice of those who fought for a better future.

The way the site is preserved allows you to connect with the past in a very real way. You can almost hear the echoes of voices and feel the desperation. It's a powerful and sobering experience that stays with you long after you leave.

For me, visiting Phu Tuong wasn't just about learning history; it was about connecting with a profound human story of suffering, resilience, and the fight for freedom. It left a deep impression on my heart and gave me a greater appreciation for the peace and liberty we have today.

If you visit Con Dao, please make time for this important place. It's a difficult but necessary experience that offers a powerful and unforgettable glimpse into the past. It's a 5/5 for its historical significance and the profound emotional impact it had on me."

However, thanks to the courage and patience of the prisoners and those who revealed the truth, this event attracted the attention of the whole world and contributed to clarifying the cruel practices.

Get a ticket at the museum.

So far, it's beautifully done; the aura of cruelty and confinement is palpable.
Especially in the cage where a guard stands in front of it and four women are crouching inside. I wonder what he was doing...

The history and the feeling of the place are conveyed.

What would be recommended: How many people were here? For how long? Were women and men separated? How often were they allowed out? Were they allowed out? Was there time for cleaning? Who had to ""roast"" outside in the open cells in the heat? (No shade)"

ChIJ8-dNvN0CNTER6Ap5xN3tQqk,"Most of the lake belongs to Quang Tien commune, Soc Son district, Hanoi city. From the center of Hanoi to Dong Quan lake is about 35-40km. The lake is located in the valley south of Soc mountain, near the way to Giong temple.
If you want to see the lake, you can only go up to the dam and walk down to the alluvial land near the edge of the lake, but most of the surrounding roads are occupied by restaurants or homestays. You cannot see the lake if you do not use the services of the restaurants.
A whole patch of forest in the opposite side of the dam has been fenced off by a private unit and a service fee is charged to enter. Even fishing in this area costs money.
The lake is very wide and deep, with some sections up to 40m deep, so services such as swimming and rowing on the lake are not licensed because they are not safe.
The air around the lake is quite cool, there are many good natural photography angles. However, the planning of the surrounding areas is messy and unsynchronized, with many spontaneous activities."

ChIJ8-dNvN0CNTER6Ap5xN3tQqk,"Located more than 30km from the center of Hanoi, Dong Quan Lake (Quang Tien Commune, Soc Son District) is an ideal place for families and groups of friends to camp for the day. As the largest lake in Soc Son, Dong Quan Lake is surrounded by 3 hills and forests, so the air is fresh, airy, the scenery is charming and quite wild. Coming to Dong Quan Lake, away from the dust and noise of the city, you will ""live slower"" when enjoying the quiet, peaceful atmosphere with relatives and friends. There are large lawns for groups to organize collective games and exercise. Bring bicycles, camping tents, snacks, cameras... to record relaxing moments together. If you do not have the conditions to bring a lot of things, you can be completely assured because here we provide full services at affordable prices. A tent for a group of 4 to 6 people costs 130,000 VND/day and 160,000 VND/night; a tent for a group of 15 people costs from 220,000 to 260,000 VND/night.

In addition, you do not have to worry about preparing food because there are pre-marinated foods for sale here such as: Hill chicken, pork: 130,000 VND/kg, chicken thighs: 90,000 VND/kg, and bread, potatoes, corn for you to grill on the stove. In addition to the cost of renting a tent and buying food, you only have to spend 45,000 - 55,000 VND/person for a day's entrance ticket or staying overnight. In addition, you do not have to pay any other costs.

One small note when coming to Dong Quan Lake is that there are many trees here, so remember to bring insect repellent and especially need to fully comply with regulations on environmental hygiene and disease prevention. 
If you have planned to go to Dong Quan Lake, you should go for 2 days and 1 night because the night is the most interesting time. What could be more wonderful than when a group of friends or families go into the forest together to collect firewood, make a fire, set up tents and cook their favorite dishes. When night falls, everyone gathers together in the flickering firelight, watching the lake sparkling under the moonlight and chatting and singing together. 
The most memorable experience is sleeping overnight in a tent in the middle of a wild natural landscape. Waking up early in the morning, a sparkling scene appears before your eyes. The gentle sunlight of dawn shines down on the lake, making everything seem to come to life. Take the opportunity to walk or run a few laps, take deep breaths of the fresh morning air, and you will welcome a day full of positive energy."

ChIJfR0xdisdNTER3TugKXpONtw,The road is very steep and has sharp turns.
ChIJfR0xdisdNTER3TugKXpONtw,
ChIJfR0xdisdNTER3TugKXpONtw,"If you are looking for a place to both **breathe fresh air** and **have a bit of Vietnamese spirituality and history**, then **Saint Giong Monument on Soc Son Mountain** is a destination worth trying at least once

- Location & Directions

About 40km from the center of Hanoi, about 1 hour by motorbike. The road to Soc Son Mountain is quite easy to go, only the last part is a bit steep. You can park your car at the foot of the mountain and **climb about 400 stone steps** to the top - a bit tiring but the scenery is very beautiful, cool and quiet.

- First impressions

Upon reaching the top, **a giant bronze statue of Saint Giong appears extremely majestic**. Giong rides an iron horse, stretching his body to fly up to the sky - looking closely, you can see every delicate, strong and proud detail. Standing close to the statue feels like being ""transmitted with energy"" of the national spirit.

- Landscape & atmosphere

The space on the top of the mountain is airy, cool wind, panoramic view of Soc Son. If you go early in the morning or late in the afternoon, the sunlight shining on the statue is extremely beautiful, looking through the camera will make the picture ""artistic"". In addition, there are **Non Nuoc Pagoda** and **Soc Temple** nearby - you can combine sightseeing, worshiping Buddha, praying for peace.

- Personal feelings

What I like most is **the feeling of climbing the mountain while enjoying the scenery**, the higher you go, the more peaceful you feel. The statue of Saint Giong is not only beautiful but also makes me feel **national pride**, remembering the story of the hero of the village of Giong who defeated the An invaders and then flew to heaven.

- Small suggestion

* You should bring drinking water and sneakers because you have to climb quite a lot.
* If you go to the temple, remember to dress politely.
* The best time is **January - March of the lunar calendar**, when there is a very exciting **Giong Soc Son festival**

👉 **A great destination for those who love nature, culture and want to calm down"

The monument was built to commemorate the merits of Phu Dong Thien Vuong - a saint in Vietnamese legend. This is one of the key cultural works to celebrate the 1000th Anniversary of Thang Long - Hanoi

The monument is cast in pure bronze, has a height to the top of 11.07 m with an extension of 16 m, and an estimated weight of 85 tons. The statue is placed on Ve Linh peak - the highest peak of Soc mountain, with the absolute height of the place where the statue is placed after completing the renovation is 297 m[3].
The statue simulates the image of a young saint carrying bamboo and ivory, spurring his horse toward the blue sky. The statue's base is shaped from the stylization of clouds and halos, clearly demonstrating the ""dynamic"" nature of the statue. The statue is placed facing the South, said to show that Saint Giong is heading to his motherland in the South (Phu Dong, Gia Lam), and at the same time is looking after the territory of the entire country of Vietnam.

Thanh Giong monument area is located on the top of Soc mountain at an altitude of about 300 m, including a 1500 m² ceremony yard, communal house and a number of auxiliary buildings such as management house, parking lot, rest hut... There are 3 paths leading to the monument area, including 1 large paved road for motor vehicles and 2 small paths with paved stairs, allowing visitors to climb from Soc temple or Non Nuoc pagoda."

I had the opportunity to visit such a place - a destination that awakens all senses and makes the soul more relaxed than ever.

As soon as I set foot, the scene before my eyes overwhelmed me. The open space, fresh air, green trees and sophisticated architectural works create a perfect picture between modern and traditional. Every detail seems to be cleverly arranged so that visitors can both enjoy the natural beauty and explore the cultural depth of that land.

What impressed me most was the way the local people organize to welcome tourists. The friendliness and thoughtfulness of the people and professional service make the tour complete. Whether participating in experiential activities, enjoying the cuisine or simply strolling around to enjoy the scenery, I always feel satisfied and relaxed. 

Not only is it a place to take photos and check-in, that attraction also helps me temporarily leave the hustle and bustle of life and find inner balance. Beautiful scenery, beautiful people, and cultural values ​​preserved over time - all create a meaningful journey. 

A truly memorable destination not only because of the scenery, but also because of the good feelings it leaves in the hearts of every visitor after leaving.

ChIJlclXM5WrNTERDqL5tGu_ugE,"Hoan Kiem Lake, the heart of Hanoi, was originally a branch of the Red River. After many ups and downs, the branches of the Red River that brought water to the city were buried, so Hoan Kiem Lake became the ""horseshoe lake"" as it is today. The lake's water surface is always green, so the lake is also called Luc Thuy. Hoan Kiem Lake is associated with the legend of the Divine Turtle who offered a precious sword to King Le Loi and when peace came, received the sword back. That legendary story is based on the true detail that Hoan Kiem Lake has a special species of Turtle, very large in size, soft shell and currently there are only a few in the world. During the Tran Dynasty, the lake was used for the purpose of training warships, at that time the area was still very large and connected to the Red River. Currently, the lake is planned to be the center of the capital, and around the lake are some famous landmarks such as Turtle Tower, The Huc Bridge, Ngoc Son Temple. On weekends, the area around the lake becomes a walking street and public playground for thousands of people. In 2025, the areas: Shark's Jaw, the power plant area will be cleared to create a square, playground, and subway station for this very busy area full of historical and legendary relics."

ChIJlclXM5WrNTERDqL5tGu_ugE,"Turtle Tower is a cultural and historical symbol, built on a small mound in the middle of Hoan Kiem Lake, Hanoi. The name Turtle Tower comes from the fact that the tower was built on the mound where the turtles of Hoan Kiem Lake often sunbathe. 
Symbolic meaning: Turtle Tower has many meanings, associated with the legend of King Le Loi returning the magic sword to the Golden Turtle and symbolizing the patriotism and studiousness of the nation. 
- The tower was built in 1884, after the French occupied Hanoi, by the wealthy tycoon Ba Ho Kim. Initially, he intended to bury the remains of his parents here, then built the tower. 
- On top of the tower there used to be a miniature Statue of Liberty, but it was demolished."

ChIJlclXM5WrNTERDqL5tGu_ugE,"🏝Hanoi Hoan Kiem Lake 📖Wikipedia: Hoan Kiem Lake (Vietnamese: Hồ Hoàn Kiếm) is a natural freshwater lake in the heart of Hanoi, Vietnam, located in the eponymous Hoan Kiem District. It is a famous landmark and tourist attraction in Hanoi, and an important place for residents to relax and have fun. During the Ly and Tran dynasties, it was called Green Water Lake. Later, due to its use as a venue for naval training and inspections, it was renamed Water Army Lake. It was also known as Zuo Wang Lake. Legend has it that Le Loi, the founding emperor of the Later Le Dynasty, once found an ancient sword in the lake and returned it to a sacred turtle in the lake, hence the name Hoan Kiem Lake. Hoan Kiem Lake is a tributary of the Red River. After its formation, it still connected to the Red River a short distance to the east, but was later separated by a levee. The lake is oval in shape, narrow from north to south, with an area of ​​approximately 12 hectares and an average depth of approximately 1.2 meters. The lake contains two small islands. The smaller one, Turtle Hill Island, is located in the center. It has no access to the shore and is inaccessible to tourists. A turtle tower stands on the island. The larger one, Ngoc Son Island, is located in the north of the lake. The Ngoc Son Shrine is built on the island. In front of the shrine, a wooden arch bridge called Qixu Bridge connects to the eastern shore.

Hoan Kiem Lake once housed one of the world's few remaining populations of Yangtze giant softshell turtles. Some Vietnamese biologists believe they are a distinct species, called the Hoan Kiem softshell turtle. On January 19, 2016, the last Yangtze giant softshell turtle in Hoan Kiem Lake was found dead, shocking the Vietnamese public. (October 14, 2025)"

ChIJlclXM5WrNTERDqL5tGu_ugE,"Hoan Kiem Lake is truly one of the most beautiful and worth-chilling places in Hanoi. Not only because of the scenery but also because of its very own “soul” – both ancient and modern, both peaceful and bustling.

During the day, the sunlight reflects on the clear blue lake surface, the wind blows coolly, sitting on the stone bench by the lake you can watch the streets, watch pedestrians, tourists take pictures, or simply let your soul drift to the rustling sound of leaves. The air is much fresher and cleaner than other central areas – the feeling is right in the heart of the city but still has its own peaceful corner.

When the sun sets, the lake lights up, Turtle Tower, The Huc Bridge, Ngoc Son Temple light up brilliantly, shimmering extremely romantically. Walking around the lake at night is an experience that never gets boring – both cool and has a gentle, pleasant vibe. On weekends, the walking street opens, there is music, street artists, children playing, the elderly exercising... creating a very ""Hanoi"" atmosphere, both modern and still imbued with identity. 

Hoan Kiem Lake is now very clean, the trees are well cared for, there are many stone benches, and comfortable seats. Sitting here all day is not boring - chilling coffee in the morning, eating around the old town at noon, walking around the lake in the afternoon, watching the lights in the evening... One lap is enough to live for the whole day."

👉 20k
At the end of the screenshot of the route, the stop of bus 64. Go to gg, search for the route of bus 64 My Dinh-Pho Ni and you will get on. The order is from bottom to top because of the total 41 stops, 1 is from Pho Ni, 41 is My Dinh.

Walk in 1km to Ham Lon Lake.
Go up the mountain to the camping and homestay.
3. When going back, the stop is right at the beginning of the exit
👉 20k

Time:
- Take your child to school and do some housework, then go to the station at 8am.
- 9am get on the bus
- 10:30am arrive at the lake
- climb the mountain until 12pm
- Lunch break, explore and go down
- 2:30pm get on the bus
- 3:40pm arrive at My Dinh
- finish picking up the kids and having dinner

💥 There are many ways to go up the mountain, around the lake are homestays, all the campsites have trails up the mountain.
If you want to climb gently, just follow the big road. If you like to take shortcuts, take the smaller, steeper trails, you should have a walking stick, there are colored ropes on the road.
If you want to climb all the way to the top, search the map for the top of the mountain, choose the home with the nearest way up and follow it.

💥 Our criteria for going is to heal, but not to tear up our wallets 🤣 At first, we wanted to go to Huong Pagoda for the romantic scenery, but it was crowded and we couldn't book a car, so we changed direction. Who would have thought it would be so convenient and cheap.

The purpose of my trip was to climb the mountain, not to camp, so the things I brought were limited, neat, mostly water, snacks available at home (eating a lot when climbing the mountain will be heavy on the stomach, causing discomfort, you can have breakfast and leave it for a delicious snack when returning to the city center)

At first, getting off the bus and walking in made me feel a bit tired. But it was very good to warm up, when climbing, my legs were less sore, and when returning, walking also helped stretch my muscles after climbing the mountain. If you don't stretch your muscles, you will have a sore groin the next day.

I didn't climb to the top, but climbed until 12 o'clock, because sometimes, in the city, I feel dusty and have difficulty breathing, and my mind is foggy. I wanted to go and sweat to wake up. Huhu, the smell of pine wood is cool and soothing, making me want to cry.

I just left and there were lychee, musk, grapefruit, jun... flowers all over the road planted by the homestay.

Before going, my friend bought lemon and salt water, and I brewed a pot of plum tea, licorice with a little salt. The conclusion is that the other tea is too sweet, if you buy it later, buy mineral water or medicine in the pharmacy. It's worse than my tea. The best thing is that it doesn't sting 🤣🤣🤣 Oh my gosh, if it stings, it'll itch like hell. The weather is cool (16-20 degrees Celsius is just cool), wearing a thin long-sleeved shirt and a spare windbreaker is enough."
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"A great place to relax and heal on the weekend. (There are many service providers, you should choose carefully to have the most enjoyable experience.)"
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"Beautiful, clean, fresh, airy. Very suitable for camping, picnicking, taking pictures, walking."
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"Few people quite comfortable - quite chill when going with friends (small group)
Ben Bai before 15k/person slightly increased to 20k/person quite reasonable but the downside is that the trash is not cleaned up... Everyone who goes camping should remember to clean up the trash because I see many people are too careless."
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,Going in the spring when the water is low is a bit boring.

ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"Traveling in the cold season is great. However, it's extremely dusty. I hope the road will be repaired soon so it will be less dusty and easier to travel."
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,Ok
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,Should go on Friday to avoid loud speakers
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"Beautiful, wide lake
Near mountains and forests so the scenery is charming 😇😇😇
Many times camping and picnicking here"
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"Traveling, renting tents, firewood or preparing food for the trip are all economical, suitable for groups of young people."
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,So beautiful
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,You can't camp by the lake. There's a lot of dust and cars near the lake. It's fine up here.
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,Love the vibe ❤
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"Not many people have come so the environment is clean. The lake water is clear. Around the lake are vast pine forests, cool. From Hanoi city center, you can go by car - motorbike - bus. Especially on weekends, many groups of cyclists come here to climb mountains, run trails, swim ......

The peak of the 462m Flagpole Mountain was formerly called the roof of Hanoi. Now, many people who go to Ham Lon Dam like to climb to the top. It takes about 120 minutes to get to the top from Ham Lon Lake (depending on the climbing and resting speed and depending on the climbing route). Be sure to prepare good climbing shoes. When going down, tie your shoes firmly because the toes are pushed down when going downhill. This is a pine forest, so the pine leaves fall all over the road. If it rains, it is very slippery. You should prepare a walking stick from home or take a small wooden tree around the house to park your car by the lake. Climb the mountain with as little gear as possible, but you must have a water bottle. The phone signal is sometimes there and sometimes not. Climbing to the top of Ham Lon, besides the road that people often take, there is a more difficult road along the dry stream bed. If it is the rainy season, you should not go because the flood water will rise and be very dangerous. When going down from the top of the Flagpole, there are many ways down: straight towards the stone slab marking the high point, go down the wide and moderately steep road. You will pass several broadcasting towers. Go down to the left of the landmark stone slab, the steep road is vertical but shorter than the above road. The landing point of these two roads is near the Ham Lon lake dam. The road behind the landmark stone slab will go down the other side of the mountain, a few kilometers away from the lake. This road is relatively steep but has more trees, in the rainy season, many trees fall. This road has many slippery rocks... In addition, there are many other roads, please explore ......
If you go all day, you should bring a phone charger, you can charge it at the parking lots, eat and drink next to Ham Lon lake. The food here is reasonably priced. A chicken costs about 300k (8/2024) A group of about 10 people eating lunch splits about 150k/person. In the long term, to ensure environmental hygiene, food vendors, parachute rental shops... next to the lake must have their own kitchen wastewater discharge lines, not discharge directly into the lake as it is now..."
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"Go on weekdays, quiet and cool. There is a service fee but it is not significant."
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"The lake is not very big, you can camp in the pine forest, it's not very cool, the sun is strong and you will get sick."
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,A place to camp for a day in harmony with the nature of Soc Son district. About 30km from Hanoi
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,

7, food: should be prepared at home

Advantages:
- clear water, lots of trees, very airy

- has full facilities for camping

Disadvantages
- this area is a bit small, so the view is not very far
- has a private toilet but dirty"
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"The lake is not very big, there is a pine forest to check-in and take pictures, there is a parking space that only costs about 20K for a car."
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"Beautiful location, suitable for camping. However, businesses that rent buoys and boats for swimming and boating do not have lifeboats, no supervisors, no loudspeakers, no warnings & regulations, no instructions for tourists, in case of emergency there are almost no measures to respond, very dangerous."
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"The lake is spacious and airy. The climbing path is very short and has a dead end. The atmosphere is quite pleasant, suitable for autumn and spring, not too crowded"
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,Very beautiful!

ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"The lake is large, spacious, clean and clear. Many people go camping around the lake. I really like swimming at Ham Lon lake. If you like survival swimming, you can choose this location. But remember to bring a swimming float."
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"People still like to camp by the lake but I think it's normal, the lake is not very big. I still like Dong Do Lake and Dong Quan Lake better!"
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"Wild nature. People can walk, climb mountains, swim....
There are villas and homestays for rent. The highlight is that they are invested by local people, so there is a friendly and close relationship between the owner and the guests. Another feature is that the electricity is great, the villas use 3-phase electricity and even a backup generator. Unlike some other places: electricity is like a struggle, others have to leave in the middle of the night"
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"Well managed lake, little waste, reasonable services. Suitable for groups. The lake is deep and if you don't know how to swim, you should bring a life buoy. The lake is a bit small, the surrounding forests are requisitioned so walking around the forest around the lake is limited."
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"Bad location, no seats. Far worse than Dong Quan Lake."

There are many camping spots around here with full services such as tent rental, parking, toilets, kitchen rental, kayaking, campfire speakers, etc.

Very suitable for 1-2 days. Those who like can climb mountains, the mountains are also very beautiful, a place where trail runners go every week."
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,Great place for workouts and weekend getaways

ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,A good weekend picnic spot for those in Hanoi. Bus route 64 takes you there. No entrance fee to the forest. Food and tent rental services available.
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"Climb to the top of Ham Lon mountain, 462m high. From the foot of the mountain to the top takes about 2 hours 30 minutes."

ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"Ham Lon Lake is an ideal camping spot near Hanoi, 40km from Hanoi, and can easily ride motorbikes, including scooters.

The lake is very clear, next to it is a pine forest, very airy. The whole camping group ate very reasonable grilled food.

There are almost all kinds of services here, including rowing, so you can just go there and rent a tent to eat, drink, and have fun.

There is Ham Lon mountain nearby, the group can go early, climb the mountain and then return to camp. Ham Lon Mountain is not too high and dangerous, many children climb here."
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"The lake is suitable for grilling chicken and camping, but the cleaning fee of 20k per person is a bit much. Because it seems like this is a spontaneous point."
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"Cool, beautiful, peaceful, but far away 😅"
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,Good
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,Fun Resort
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,It would be better to have a management board and garbage collection.
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"A great place for weekend camping with your family and team:
- Cool spacious space
- Fresh air, large lake for boating
- The road up is a bit small, needs to be widened."

ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"A service that also rents tents... haha But... it can't compare to mine, right?"
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"Suitable place for camping, relaxing, quiet"
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"Beautiful, suitable for picnics with friends"
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"Camping/ trekking/ trail running/ walking/ cycling/ swimming/ SUP kayaking or any outside activities can be enjoyed here.
Time to relax, refresh and keep peace in mind"
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"I went hiking so I didn't ask about swimming or boating, but I think you have to rent it from the service areas there. The lake embankment is quite steep so if you want to go down, you probably need a life jacket to be safe.

The traffic is relatively convenient. Suitable for a picnic during the day."

ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,Cool
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"Only about 40km from the center of Hanoi, this will be an ideal camping spot on the weekend. The space is airy and fresh, there are many camping areas around the lake. You can experience mountain climbing and walking, which is also very chill."
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,Camping ok
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,Absolutely beautiful 💚💚💚
ChIJQ6BVP0YdNTERMxronuGXeQo,"The water is clear, there are rocky shores to sit and watch the lake and take good photos.
In general, the purpose of camping is just to stay below, not to climb the mountain, you can also walk around the lake a bit, but there is not much beautiful scenery."

A few words about Non Nuoc Soc Son Pagoda, Hanoi. 
Non Nuoc Soc Son Pagoda, also known as Soc Son Vuong Thien Tu, is located in Phu Linh commune, Soc Son district, Hanoi city. The ancient pagoda is located in the famous Soc Temple relic complex, at an altitude of more than 110m above the foot of the mountain. Non Nuoc Pagoda is a place to worship Buddha according to the Northern Buddhist sect - one of the largest Buddhist sects in our country."
ChIJ_V_GQtUcNTERYnxCOrT3yfo,"Big, beautiful, quiet temple"
ChIJ_V_GQtUcNTERYnxCOrT3yfo,"Non Nuoc Pagoda - first time visiting🥰

The first time visiting, I was really surprised. It's been a long time since I had such a ""Wow"" feeling about a pagoda with majestic but somewhat mysterious architecture on the mountain. The pagoda is isolated on a high mountain, the architecture is harmonious, the roof is softly curved between the clouds of Soc Son. The air is quiet, fresh, each step seems lighter.
The pagoda was quite deserted when I visited, there were only a few soldiers, nuns and novices sweeping the outside of the pagoda. I stood still for a while, not because my feet were tired, but because of the atmosphere...
I didn't expect there to be a place with such a strange architecture.

It is known that the ancient pagoda dates back to the Tien Le Dynasty, where Zen Master Ngo Chan Luu, who was given the title Khuong Viet Dai Su by King Dinh, used to preside over it.

The history of Non Nuoc Pagoda dates back a long time. The temple's documents record that, based on the book Thien Uyen Tap Anh and the book Dai Viet Su Ky Toan Thu, the abbot of the temple was Ngo Chan Luu (933 - 1011), a member of the 4th generation of the Vo Ngon Thong Zen sect. In 971, he was given the title Khuong Viet Dai Su by King Dinh Tien Hoang. By the end of the Ly Dynasty, the temple had two eminent abbots, Zen Master Truong Nguyen (1110 - 1165) and Zen Master Nguyen Hoc (? - 1181), both of whom belonged to the 10th generation of the Vo Ngon Thong Zen sect.

I will definitely come back. Not necessarily because of my beliefs, but because of the rare feeling of standing in the middle of mountains and rivers, and feeling at peace.

P/s: For those who like to take souvenir photos, there are also many beautiful ancient-style photo angles here🥰

According to legend, after defeating the An invaders, on the way back to Soc Mountain, Saint Giong stopped here and went down to bathe in West Lake. On the way, Saint Giong forgot his iron whip that was broken in the battle. Therefore, the people built a temple to worship him.

ChIJ_V_GQtUcNTERYnxCOrT3yfo,"Non Nuoc Pagoda (literally Soc Thien Vuong Thien Tu) is located in the Soc Temple relic complex at an altitude of more than 110 m above the foot of the mountain. The pagoda is located right in the middle of the arc-shaped mountain range, like a person sitting on a throne, looking down at the clear blue lake and the prosperous villages of Ve Linh village, Phu Linh commune, Soc Son district, Hanoi city. According to Thien Uyen Tap Anh and Dai Viet Su Ky Toan Thu, the first Zen master to preside over this pagoda was Ngo Chan Luu (933-1011), a descendant of Ngo Quyen. In 971, he was given the title Khuong Viet Quoc Su by King Dinh Tien Hoang. He was the first Zen master to be awarded the title Quoc Su by the feudal state of Vietnam. History records that this Quoc Su and Van Hanh Zen Master assisted Ly Cong Uan in ascending the throne. In 1010, Ly Cong Uan moved the capital from Hoa Lu (Ninh Binh) to Thang Long, opening the most prosperous period in Vietnamese history. Khuong Viet National Master became the National Master of Vietnam three dynasties (spanning three dynasties Dinh - Le - Ly)."

ChIJ_V_GQtUcNTERYnxCOrT3yfo,"The ancient pagoda has a history of more than 1,000 years. The pagoda was built on the old pagoda land from the Tien Le Dynasty, in the ancient pagoda architectural style of 7 compartments and 2 wings, decorated with motifs and patterns also following the original model of the Tien Le Dynasty. 

Because it is at an altitude of 110m above the foot of the mountain, the pagoda is very cool and has a peaceful space"

The architecture has a unique, nostalgic look
2. Minus points:
- not many activities, it takes 30 minutes to walk.
- Haven't seen any place, no tickets sold, requires MANDATORY purchase of a guidebook for 150k to enter, creating discomfort and grabbing right from the first step when arriving at Viet Phu."

It is among the rare places that still preserve, almost intact, the ancient charm, traditional way of life, and authentic atmosphere of a Northern Vietnamese village.

The mild, pleasant climate makes wandering through the village a refreshing and soothing experience, perfect for those seeking peace and cultural immersion. The setting is also exceptionally photogenic, especially for traditional ao dai photoshoots.

For travelers interested in history, culture, and photography, this destination offers a unique glimpse into Vietnam’s heritage. It is also worth noting the importance of ongoing preservation efforts. With thoughtful policies, the site can continue to safeguard its cultural significance while also providing sustainable economic opportunities for the local community."

This is an ideal place to take photos with a space full of cultural features. The ancient houses with yin-yang tiled roofs, square brick courtyards and red parallel sentences bring the atmosphere of the old Tet. The lake in the palace reflects the cool green trees, suitable for traditional Ao Dai photos.

I have been here many times and still want to have the opportunity to come back, if you want a quiet place and discover many unique features, through modern or folk art works. 

I see many comments that the entrance fee of 150,000 is expensive, I disagree with this comment, simply because that number is still small compared to the investment of an individual, you will not be able to find such things in state-run museums. 

I took these photos 10 years ago, now it is very possible that the exhibition area has been supplemented with many new artifacts or scenes."

ChIJ0wb2R7gCNTERhBjuJfCNbdE,
ChIJ0wb2R7gCNTERhBjuJfCNbdE,"This is a private museum displaying ancient Vietnamese architecture and architectural decorative artifacts.
Overall, the space is very interesting, recreating the life of Vietnamese people over the past 100-200 years. Northern cultural regions are reproduced richly and clearly, with many artifacts.
However, the artifacts are mostly antique imitations or reconstructions, with few original antiques.
Museum entrance fee on May 2, 2025 is 150k/person. Quite expensive compared to a museum of similar size and artifacts.
The plus point here is that the space is close and extremely green. It's midday in summer but the outdoor air is very cool.
Parking here is quite limited, you will need to park along the road"
ChIJ0wb2R7gCNTERhBjuJfCNbdE,"On April 30th, my family and friends visited Viet Phu, which we had heard about for a long time. Hearing a hundred times is not as good as seeing once. An inspiring place. I love my country so much."

ChIJ0wb2R7gCNTERhBjuJfCNbdE,"The ancient space is perfectly recreated, very beautiful when viewing the Palace in the sunset from the pine forest by the lake."
ChIJ0wb2R7gCNTERhBjuJfCNbdE,"The place preserves the thousand-year-old cultural architecture of the Vietnamese people with a massive amount of works such as stilt houses, wells, temples, communal houses, Buddha statues, water puppet lakes... Artist Thanh Chuong has excelled in designing these classical and purely Vietnamese works on a land area of ​​about 1 hectare. The land has many different heights, but the artist has cleverly arranged the works in the most suitable positions, while this work honors the beauty of the adjacent work. The entire Viet Palace is covered by many types of ancient trees, so on hot summer days, the air and temperature are always cooler than the surrounding areas. The ancient wells were built from dozens of stone mortars, the well walls are made of stone, and there are still many worn traces from rope marks hundreds of years ago. A stilt house is firmly preserved at the original level with a thatched roof, wooden pillars and probably only used mortise and tenon joints. The thatched house was newly built but still retained the structure and materials from the past, this type of house only remains in childhood memories."
ChIJ0wb2R7gCNTERhBjuJfCNbdE,"This place has a rich collection, not easy to absorb in 1 day without being equipped with knowledge about Vietnamese culture and history. Many beautiful angles to take photos in the style of Northern countryside."
ChIJ0wb2R7gCNTERhBjuJfCNbdE,"Very quiet and beautiful place, it's worth to spend around 2 hours there."
ChIJ0wb2R7gCNTERhBjuJfCNbdE,There is a sitting corner close to the ancient tree root

ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,The ruins of a church built by the French during colonial time which give you a nostalgic feeling and a subtle sadness. Good spot for photography
ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,"Beautiful, cool, has clean water source, can camp."
ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,The natural ecosystem is very impressive.
ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,Just bad memories here for the locals.

ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,
ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,No sign for the road and entry from the main road is steep but ok with 2 people on a 110cc bike.  Saw a snake near the bathroom.  Nice quick stop while cloud hunting

ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,
ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,"When I arrived, it started to rain heavily. The scene was quite spooky, with many fallen trees along the road. The slope up to the abandoned house was very high and slippery. You need to drive steadily (I drove a 7-seater car)."
ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,"Even though it is just ruins, it is still very beautiful and attractive. The old churches always have a nostalgic beauty. I went on the weekend but there were very few people. This is a great place to go if you want to relax alone."
ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,"Very cool and quiet, fresh air, great"
ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,"it was so beautiful guys, though the way to go up there a bit high and dangerous for motorbike but the scene was so worth. u definitely should go there if u have chance to Ba Vi"

ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,I went on a rainy day and it was deserted so it looked ghostly.

Do not trust Google Maps, ask the locals how to get here, you have to climb a very high slope, I was tired myself for a few steps. Cars and bikes will have a hard time of going up but stay calm and safe."

ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,Beautiful eerie spot
ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,
ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,"A small stone church, probably nearly a hundred years old, is nestled in the primeval forest halfway up Tan Vien mountain. Although the roof has completely collapsed, some stone walls are still standing, some windows and arched doors are still intact, the cross symbol is still on the wall, the slender bell tower is tall. After many events of time and war, the materials to build the roof, the furniture and the doors are no longer there, instead many types of natural forest trees grow interspersed inside and around the church, vines and moss cover the corners of the walls, making the church magically beautiful, especially when the sunlight shines through the leaves. The summer weather here is very cool because the church is located in a large forest with very few constructions. The road up is quite steep, curved and small, so traveling by car is very difficult and dangerous. Highland tourist areas with similar terrain to Ba Vi such as Sapa and Tam Dao all have ancient churches built of stone and are still relatively intact to this day."

ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,"In the heart of the majestic mountains of Ba Vi, a mysterious and unexpectedly attractive destination awaiting visitors is the Ba Vi collapsed church. Built with a delicate combination of European architecture and nostalgia of the past, this church has witnessed many ups and downs of history, but still retains its unique and pure look in the clouds of Ba Vi sky."
ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,
ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,"At an altitude of 800. Cool, fresh air, no services"
ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,
ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,"Cool stop worth checking out if you like ruins, historic buildings or photography"
ChIJl57bXd5gNDERkWNgFjtp5b4,"There isn't much there, but it's a place you should visit at least once. It's really nice and picturesque. However, the downside is that it is difficult to find the entrance and it is a bit difficult to get a car to enter."

ChIJP_qrg_KrNTERnOWkD67p0p8,"Ham Long Church, with its full name of Saint Anthony Church, is located on the peaceful Ham Long Street in the center of Hanoi. Different from the ancient and massive appearance of the Great Church, Ham Long has its own beauty, both solemn and close, warm, attracting all eyes with its unique architecture and peaceful space. 

Ham Long Church was built in 1934, designed and supervised by French priest Antoine Depaulis. The architecture of the church is a harmonious combination of classical Gothic style and local materials, creating an impressive and unique work. 

At first sight, the church makes a strong impression with three facades opening to the main streets of Ham Long, Ngo Thi Nham and Phan Chu Trinh. This creates an airy space, attracting natural light and bringing a sense of spaciousness. The main construction materials are boulders, terracotta bricks and lime mortar, creating a rustic, intimate but still solid and sturdy beauty. 

Inside the church, the space becomes even more splendid and magical. With a system of soaring domes, large pillars and exquisite stained glass windows, the light from the outside shines in, creating a sacred, pure space. The most prominent is the elaborately carved altar, along with solemnly placed statues of saints. All details show the meticulousness and ingenuity of the craftsmen, bringing a unique artistic beauty. 

Not only an architectural work, Ham Long Church is also a space of peace and faith. Located in a crowded area, the church brings a strange sense of tranquility. When entering the campus, you will feel separated from the noise of the streets. 

For parishioners, Ham Long Church is a common home where they pray together, share their faith and find comfort in their souls. Especially, on major holidays such as Christmas or Easter, the church is splendidly decorated, attracting not only parishioners but also tourists to visit and admire. 

In addition, the church also plays an important role in preserving and promoting cultural and religious values. Community activities, catechism classes and hymn concerts are regularly held, helping to strengthen solidarity and spread good values. 

Ham Long Church is an architectural and cultural highlight of Hanoi. This place is not only a religious building but also an artistic space, a peaceful place for people to find peace of mind. With its unique beauty and important role in the community, Ham Long Church deserves to be a destination not to be missed when exploring the beauty of the capital."

ChIJP_qrg_KrNTERnOWkD67p0p8,"Ham Long Church is located in the central area of ​​Hanoi and is also known as St. Anton Church. St. Anton is a Portuguese priest with a profound knowledge of theology and the Bible, and is said to have performed miracles. The church was completed in 1939 and designed by Vietnamese architect Ly Duc Than. Although not as large as Hanoi Cathedral, the design is also beautiful and impressive. Due to the use of domes with traditional materials such as lime, straw, and paper, the sound resonates in the church space, so there is no need for modern sound equipment and the speeches still have clear sound. Due to the small area of ​​the campus, the church rooms, statues, and miniatures are quite small, but they are carefully crafted, meticulous, and very beautiful. In particular, the statues are carved very vividly and beautifully. The church is located at the intersection of Ham Long and Ngo Thi Nham streets, so traffic is very convenient."

ChIJUWAbMH-rNTERQMeqJ1gRJlg,"Thai Ha Church is one of the important religious centers of the Archdiocese of Hanoi, closely associated with the history of formation, development and memorable events of Vietnamese Catholicism. This place is not only a sacred pilgrimage site but also a symbol of the steadfastness and steadfast faith of the community of believers. 

1. History of formation and development

Thai Ha Church belongs to the Redemptorist Order, founded in 1928 by Redemptorist priests from Canada. With the mission of spreading the Gospel and serving the poor, the monks here have played an important role in developing the faith life of the parishioners in the Hanoi area. 

Over many historical periods, the church has continuously expanded in scale and influence, becoming a place where a large number of parishioners gather to attend mass, learn catechism and practice charitable activities. 

2. Architecture and sacred space

Thai Ha Church has a strong European architectural style, with a typical Gothic style. The church is designed with a high dome, creating a solemn and sacred space. Inside, the altars are elaborately decorated, highlighted by the statue of Our Lady of Perpetual Help - the patron saint of the Redemptorists.

The church grounds are spacious, with many spaces for pastoral activities, helping parishioners have a place to meditate and pray. In particular, the statue of Our Lady of Perpetual Help right in front of the church yard is an important highlight, where believers come to offer prayers in difficult times.

3. Important events

Thai Ha Church is not only a place of worship but also a witness to many historical events. One of the most prominent events is the land dispute between the Catholic Church and the local government, which has been going on since 2008. Thai Ha Parish has been persistently fighting to reclaim land that belonged to the Church but was confiscated in the past. 

The prayer marches of parishioners here have attracted great attention, becoming a symbol of steadfastness in faith and justice. Despite many difficulties, the parish still maintains its mission of serving parishioners and continues important pastoral activities. 

4. Religious and pastoral activities 

Thai Ha Church is one of the most dynamic Catholic centers in Hanoi, with many religious and charitable activities. Every week, the mass here attracts a large number of parishioners. In particular, the prayer sessions with Our Lady of Perpetual Help every Wednesday are of interest to many believers, becoming a special spiritual tradition of the parish. 

In addition, the church also organizes programs to support the poor, care for the sick and educate the faith for young people. These activities clearly demonstrate the spirit of love and service of the Redemptorists.

5. Conclusion

Thai Ha Church is not only a beautiful architectural work but also an important center of faith of Hanoi Catholicism. With its long history, sacred space and profound historical imprints, this place has become an indispensable destination for believers as well as tourists who want to learn about Vietnamese Catholicism.

Despite many events, Thai Ha parish has maintained its perseverance and loyalty to the faith, continuing to be a bright spot in the religious life of the Vietnamese Catholic community."

ChIJRbk0UJSrNTERjtl_eCB2tZA,"The St. Joseph's Cathedral, Hanoi (official name: St. Joseph's Cathedral, Hanoi) is a magnificent Catholic church built during the French colonial period, located near Hanoi's Old Quarter. It appears to be a very popular tourist attraction (just a few minutes' walk from Hoan Kiem Lake).
Constructed in 1886 (during the French colonial period) in the Neo-Gothic style, it is said to have been modeled after Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Its impressive stonework features twin towers approximately 64 meters high."

St. Joseph's Cathedral, located in Hanoi's Old Quarter, is a stunning architectural work that is a testament to the city's rich history and architectural heritage. Built during the French colonial period, the church is reminiscent of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, with its towering spires and intricate stained glass windows. The church bells ring out in the heart of the Old Quarter…. 
Outside, its ancient facade exudes timeless beauty, while inside it offers a serene and spiritual atmosphere. Visitors can admire the ornate altars, traditional carvings and brilliant stained glass windows that add color to the solemn space. The church remains an active place of worship, regularly hosting services that attract both locals and tourists. 
The Cathedral Street surrounding the church is a vibrant area with many cafes, boutiques and restaurants, making it the perfect place to explore after visiting the landmark."

ChIJRbk0UJSrNTERjtl_eCB2tZA,"On my last day of visiting Hanoi Vietnam (today),I planned on attending mass in English session at 11:30am before I leave the country. As I was there attempting to enter the house of the Lord, there was a man at the gate blocking entry. I get it. It’s a landmark building, flocking with tourists. Need to maintain order. I explained to him politely and nicely that I am here to attend the mass not simply being a tourist. But he wouldn’t even listen nor look at me and kept saying “no visit no visit”. I attempted again and again but he was still very persistently refusing entry. Meanwhile a lot of others obviously foreigners looking people going in seamlessly as they should be. I was so frustrated. I wasn’t gonna ruin my plan and attempted to speak to the other lady there using translator to make sure she understood me perfectly, she responded in perfect english and was finally granted entry. Mind you, this lady was right beside while all this was happening. She didn’t interfere earlier while understanding my pleas to enter.
The frustration lingered on until I was inside.
The sermon was about “self knowledge and humility” which was a good reminder for my consciousness.
Thankfully I could eventually came at peace while reciting the Lord’s Prayer at the end of the mass. While leaving, my initial plan to tell the man how he was a disgrace was absolved. I looked for him to forgive him and also to ask for forgiveness that I was mad at him while he was simply doing his job. But I couldn’t find him anymore.
This was my experience attending the mass.
Anyway, the cathedral is great."

ChIJRbk0UJSrNTERjtl_eCB2tZA,"A neo-Gothic Catholic cathedral built between 1882 and 1886. Its interior has two aisles, making it a medium-sized cathedral. It has a main altar and four secondary altars. Considering this is a non-Catholic country, one must recognize the enormous effort made by its Catholic community to create a building of this caliber. Its interior is simple with stamped concrete walls. Almost nothing fancy, with quarry stone, which in my opinion makes it more attractive. Inside, there is a scale replica made of beautifully crafted wood. Located in a lively neighborhood."

The church was built from the location of Bao Thien Pagoda, this large pagoda was built during the Ly Dynasty, and was destroyed many times through years of war. The Cathedral was built with bell towers on both sides, in the middle is a stone cross. Some important materials were imported from France such as 5 bells and 1 clock on the facade. In front is a statue of the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus, standing on a fierce beast with bared teeth, but the faces of the Virgin Mary and the Child Jesus are very peaceful, without any anxiety.

Approaching the cathedral, you can sense the traces of history and the test of time. The grayish-white stone walls and carved details shimmer in the sunlight, exuding an ancient and sacred atmosphere. The square in front of the cathedral, featuring a statue of the Virgin Mary and a garden, is a popular spot for worshippers to pray, travelers to rest, and take photos.

ChIJRbk0UJSrNTERjtl_eCB2tZA,"I attended Mass on Sunday at 6 o'clock in Vietnamese. The bishop presided, and there were quite a few local parishioners in attendance. I couldn't understand the Vietnamese, but since the Mass ritual and order were similar to those in Korea, I turned on the Catholic app on silent mode and prayed in Korean during Mass. It was a wonderful experience to be able to celebrate Sundays with Mass, even during my trip, and it was a special experience. The main entrance was blocked by a large Jubilee cloth, so I entered through the right-hand side door. However, the area around the cathedral was very crowded and crowded with tourists, so it was a bit noisy."
ChIJRbk0UJSrNTERjtl_eCB2tZA,"Even though it was past 5 p.m., I was lucky enough to be able to enter the cathedral. It was incredibly crowded and noisy outside, but it was surprisingly rare to see anyone praying inside. The sacristy next to the cathedral was also quite large, but it was locked, which was a shame. 🥹"
ChIJRbk0UJSrNTERjtl_eCB2tZA,It's the oldest church in Hanoi. A must visit place. But take note of the opening times. To go inside please dress appropriately. It's a house of God. Don't talk loudly as ppl might be praying.

If you aren’t dressed appropriately, there are thin cover-ups available at the entrance. Inside, the stained-glass details are beautiful. It’s a great spot for photography, sightseeing, or just taking a moment to admire the craftsmanship and history."

ChIJSXwdOKOrNTERNylYj9mnIbU,"My mom and I walked by here and asked about the ticket price which is 100k per ticket (= 2 bowls of Phở). And to be honest I'd rather eat 2 bowls of Phở than paying to go inside.
Also I had before attended an event in the front space right outside the gate. The grass was poorly maintained. There was a gloomy cast over it. I refused to pay not because I don't like history or didn't have the money, but i knew there was nothing to see or do here. However it does look mystical and glowing during the night.

Save yourself time. The only places that are worth seeing in Hanoi are Hỏa Lò Prison, Ethnic Museum, Puppet Shows, Old Quarter, and High Arts Museum. Everywhere else is poorly organized and run down. Sorry not sorry. Better head outside Hanoi to explore nature."

ChIJSXwdOKOrNTERNylYj9mnIbU,Associated with Hanoi's history
ChIJSXwdOKOrNTERNylYj9mnIbU,
ChIJSXwdOKOrNTERNylYj9mnIbU,"Quietly nestled in the heart of Vietnam's capital, Hanoi, the Imperial Citadel of Thang Long is a relatively recent historical site, having been inscribed as Vietnam's sixth World Heritage Site in 2010. This site is more than just an ancient city wall; it's a ""living layer of history,"" a record of the rise and fall of Vietnamese dynasties spanning over a thousand years, layer upon layer.

The name of the site, Thang Long, means ""rising dragon."" It is the ancient name of Hanoi, which served as the administrative center of various dynasties from 1010, when Ly Taizu, founder of the Ly Dynasty, established the capital here, until the Nguyen Dynasty moved its capital to Hue in 1804.

Walking through this vast site is a grand historical pilgrimage, reliving how power was exercised in Vietnam from the 7th to the 19th centuries. The fact that it opened to the public to commemorate the 1,000th anniversary of the founding of Hanoi speaks volumes about its importance to Vietnam's national identity.

The most interesting feature of Thang Long Citadel is the fact that ruins from different eras have been discovered layered on top of each other. This shows the continuity of history, with successive dynasties building new administrative centers on the foundations of the previous dynasty.

In particular, the fact that full-scale excavations began in 2003 means that the site represents an ongoing history, rather than a ""complete history."" The Hoang Dieu 18 Archaeological Site, where investigations and excavations are still ongoing, is at the forefront of this research, exuding the romantic archaeological romance of unearthing the past buried underground (however, access may be restricted due to re-examinations, so it's essential to check in advance).


Though its simple exterior belies its simplicity, Thang Long Citadel is a place densely packed with Hanoi's long history and Vietnam's roots. The reasonable admission fee of 30,000 VND for adults is also very reasonable considering its historical value.
Visiting this ruins will be more than just a look at the city walls; it will be a valuable experience that allows you to feel firsthand the indomitable spirit and dynastic history of Vietnam, as embodied in the name ""Rising Dragon."

ChIJSXwdOKOrNTERNylYj9mnIbU,"Entrance to the park costs 100,000 VND. There were no lines, and there are plenty of places to visit besides the citadel."

I understand it's cultural importance and archaeological value but it isn't getting very much care and attention.
I kid you not when I say that it's a rubbish dump in one corner and a great many of the buildings are in a state of considerable disrepair. I would happily pay more to enter in order that they spend some money on upkeep.
Also the garden in front is basically a stage for sports, concerts and events with a stage completely blocking the view of the principle building.

The building was built under the reign of King Tu Duc, usually dated 1852, with the purpose of providing a place for the king and his courtiers to rest, enjoy the cool air and receive the river breeze before boarding the royal boat.
In terms of architecture, Nghenh Luong Dinh has a pavilion layout (pavilion) in the style of the Nguyen Dynasty palace, placed partly on a stone pedestal close to the water's edge, tiled roof in the traditional palace style, with carvings, columns and railings decorated in ancient Hue motifs. Some professional descriptions emphasize the symmetry and the surrounding wings creating an open space facing the river.
The relic is considered a landscape highlight of the ancient capital, closely associated with royal court rituals and the life of the Nguyen Dynasty; it is currently part of the Hue Citadel relic tour and appears in many travel guides to Hue."

Nghinh Luong Dinh is located on the bank of the Huong River, in the Hue Imperial Citadel area. This work was built in 1823 under the reign of King Minh Mang, with the main purpose of welcoming delegations of envoys, distinguished guests or important events in the royal court.

This is a relic in the complex of Hue ancient capital relics. 

Nghenh Luong pavilion was built under the reign of King Tu Duc 5 (1852), in the 15th year of Thanh Thai (1903) it was carefully restored and in the 3rd year of Khai Dinh (1918) it was embellished once again to serve the king who often came to cool off, from the time of Khai Dinh onwards it was called Nghenh Luong pavilion - the word Nghenh Luong pavilion means a water pavilion for cooling off[1]. Previously, the court blocked the road from The Nhon gate (ie Ngan gate) to Nghenh Luong pavilion, not allowing anyone to pass or see the king. 

Nghenh Luong pavilion has a square-style structure with 1 room and 4 wings, with crab-shell houses extending in the front and back. The wooden frame on the upper part, especially the crab-shell rafters and the three-way system are elaborately carved. The main roof is covered with yellow glazed tiles, the two crab-shell houses are covered with yellow glazed tiles.

The landscape around the pavilion is airy and very lyrical.

Nghenh Luong pavilion
Considering the spatial structure on the axis in front of the Citadel, Nghenh Luong pavilion is the connecting point between Ky Dai - Phu Van Lau - Huong Giang - Ngu Binh. And this is also a beautiful location to admire and feel the romantic beauty of the Huong River at dawn, at dusk or on a moonlit night.

Originally, Nghenh Luong Ta was a part of the Huong Giang Palace built in the 5th year of Tu Duc on the north bank of the Huong River, in front of Phu Van Lau. In addition to this palace, in the Hue area, the Nguyen kings also had many other palaces such as Than Phu Palace, Thuan Truc Palace, Thuan An Palace, Thuy Van Palace... All of these palaces had pavilions to serve the king, however, to this day, only Nghenh Luong Ta of Huong Giang Palace still exists.

To find the most essential information, the one you enter through the main gate is at the far left of the map. I almost got lost because of how exhausting this visit can be. Get an audio guide, it's essential, and if you can, rent an electric bike too; I didn't realize it was so big. Beware, the cafe in the Imperial Garden is a rip-off. Don't even drink the water there.

While the temperatures are high and the sun is strong, once you pass through the main gate and enter the palace grounds, you'll find tranquil gardens, ponds, and pavilions, perfect for a brief respite. Each building features intricate carvings and unique colors, and the blend of traditional Vietnamese and Chinese architecture is a delight to behold.

It's a wonderful photo opportunity, and the historical context makes it even more engaging. Be sure to bring a hat and water on hot days.

ChIJ-zZHO4GhQTER8_Eb9kDoaEE,"Hue Imperial Palace was the capital of Vietnam's last dynasty, the Nguyen Dynasty (1802-1945), and is Vietnam's first World Heritage Site (Hue Historic Monuments).
🏰 Overview of Hue Imperial Palace
Historical Background:
Construction began in 1804 under Emperor Gia Long, the first emperor of the Nguyen Dynasty.
Until the end of the monarchy in 1945, 13 emperors reigned over the palace and it served as the political and cultural center of Vietnam.
While influenced by the Forbidden City in Beijing, China, it reflects Vietnam's unique imperial culture.
Size and Structure:
Spread over a vast area (approximately 50 hectares), the palace is surrounded by city walls and a moat.
The interior of the Royal Palace consisted of areas such as the Imperial City (Hoàng Thành), where the emperor worked and performed ceremonies, and the Forbidden City (Tử Cấm Thành), where the emperor and his family lived.

Current Status:

Although much of the palace was destroyed during the Vietnam War (particularly the Tet Offensive of 1968), extensive restoration work is currently underway, and it is gradually being restored to its former glory.

✨Major Attractions

Winter Gate (Ngọ Môn)

This is the Royal Palace's symbolic main gate. It is an imposing structure measuring approximately 17 meters high and 58 meters wide, and the central gate was reserved for the emperor. ""Winter"" refers to the south.

Tai Wa Hall (Điện Thái Hòa)

This is the main hall where important ceremonies, such as the emperor's coronation, were held. It features a lavish interior and houses the emperor's throne.

Hiển Lâm Các (Hien Lam Các) and Thế Tổ Miếu (Thế Miếu)

Hiển Lâm Các is a monumental building approximately 17 meters tall, standing at the entrance to the Thế Tổ Miếu Temple, which enshrines the emperors of the Nguyen dynasty. The temple houses the memorial tablets of the Nguyen dynasty's successive emperors.

Duyệt Thị Đường (Duyet Thi Duong)

One of Vietnam's oldest theaters, this was once used by emperors and members of the royal family to watch court music performances. Today, you can enjoy court music performances, which are registered as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
Dien Kien Trung (Điện Kiến Trung)
This building served as the residence and workplace of the last emperor, Bao Dai, and was built in a colonial style incorporating French influences. It was once destroyed, but has recently been rebuilt and is now open to the public."

Passing through the mossy gate, built in 1808 and rebuilt in 1873, you will immediately feel the peaceful space with a cool green garden, shaded by ancient trees. The pagoda grounds are quite large and are also designed in the traditional ""Khau"" style, including the main hall, the monks' dormitory, the guest house and the back house, creating a harmonious and airy layout. The main hall is built in the style of ""chong luong trung thiem"", the pillars and walls are beautifully inlaid with ceramic pieces, with sophisticated dragon motifs, exuding the solemnity of ancient Vietnamese architecture. In the temple grounds, there are many octagonal tower tombs, which are the resting place of high monks. The lotus symbol is always placed on top of the tower, symbolizing the spirit of Buddhism. In addition, there is also a well called Ham Long well, with a clear, sweet stream of water associated with the legend of Lord Nguyen suppressing the dragon vein, which is the mystery that attracts everyone's curiosity. The temple is not only a place of worship but also a training center for monks and nuns. Buddhist schools have been held here since the 1930s. Under the abbotship of the monks over many years, Bao Quoc Pagoda still retains its sacredness, a destination to find peace, explore Hue culture and architecture. In addition, there are two longan trees full of fruit, which still linger when leaving. We invite you to visit the temple to feel the quiet space and immerse yourself in beautiful photos, especially for those who are passionate about feng shui."

The pagoda feels very ancient, spacious and cool. The three-entrance gate is very beautiful, the main church area is closed and the tomb tower area is behind. I mainly walked around the campus. 

There was no parking space, so I asked a guy living near the pagoda to keep my car while I visited the pagoda for a while and he was very happy to keep my car for me.

Bao Quoc Pagoda is a Buddhist temple in the historic city of Hue in central Vietnam. It was one of the three national temples of the city during the Nguyen Dynasty.

The temple is located on Bao Quoc Street, Phuong Duc Ward in Hue. It is located south of the Perfume River and about one kilometer west of the city center. The temple is located on a small hill called Ham Long and a stream flows from the top of the hill down to the temple grounds.

Bao Quoc Pagoda was built in 1670 by the Chinese Buddhist monk Thich Giac Phong, and was originally named Ham Long Son Thien Tho Tu during the reign of Nguyen Phuc Tan, one of the Nguyen who ruled central Vietnam during any period. In 1747, Nguyen Phuc Khoat gave the temple a section with the name Sac Tu Bao Quoc Tu.

During the Nguyen Dynasty, founded by Emperor Gia Long in 1802, the temple was frequently renovated and expanded. In 1808, Empress Hieu Khuong, wife of Gia Long, sponsored various construction projects, including the construction of a triple gate and the casting of a large bell and gong. Thien Tho Pagoda was renamed Thien Tho Pagoda. The abbot who oversaw these changes was Zen master Thich Pho Tinh. In 1824, Emperor Minh Mang, son of Gia Long, visited the temple and changed the name to its current title. He held a 40th birthday celebration at the temple in 1830.

Over the years, the temple began to decline, and in 1858 a series of renovation efforts began under Emperor Tu Duc, Minh Mang's grandson, funded directly by the royal family. These continued until the end of the century.

In the 1930s, Bao Quoc was the scene of a revival in Vietnamese Buddhist education. In 1935, a Buddhist school was opened, and in 1940, a monastery for training monks was established, which is still in operation today. In 1957, the latest phase of construction and renovation took place with the support of the Provincial Buddhist Association, and under the supervision of the temple's abbot and director of Buddhist studies in the region, Thich Tri Thu. 

The temple is built on a 2ha plot. Entering the temple through three gates, there is a spacious courtyard with a lot of plant life, surrounded by balcony buildings. On the left are the tombs dedicated to Buddhist patriarchs, the oldest of which is Thich Giac Phong, built in 1714 and standing 3.30m high. The main temple building has four pillars with dragon figures built on them. 

The largest statue in the temple is the statue of the three Buddhas with two sets of Mahayana sutras. In front of the statue is a small altar, in which some relics of Gautama Buddha are displayed. Another altar has a statue of Gautama Buddha, flanked by Ananda and Mahakassapa, who were his personal attendants and the first patriarchs of Buddhism after his death. Another altar has a copy of the Lotus Sutra, flanked by a ceremonial bell and a wooden gong.

ChIJ0wVgLJemQTERunn1THqLJvc,"Thien Mu Pagoda (Chùa Thiên Mụ, Tian Mò Pagoda) is one of the oldest and most beautiful temples in Hue, the ancient capital of central Vietnam.

Key Features and Attractions:

History and Origin:

It was built in 1601 by Nguyen Hoang, the first ruler of the Cantonment Dynasty (ancestor of the later Nguyen Dynasty).

It is the only monumental structure in Hue that predates the Nguyen Dynasty.

The name comes from a legend that when Nguyen Hoang visited the site, he heard an old woman (a celestial maiden) appear on a hill and prophesy that ""the true master will come and build a temple to strengthen the country."" ""Tian Mu"" means ""celestial maiden"" or ""celestial maiden.""
Phuoc Duyen Tower (Phước Duyên Tower) / Từ Nhân Tower (Từ Nhân Tower):
This 21-meter-tall, seven-story octagonal pagoda is the symbol of Thien Mu Pagoda.

It was built in 1844 by Emperor Thieu Tri, the third emperor of the Nguyen dynasty.

A Buddha statue is enshrined on each floor, making it a beloved symbol of Hue.

Hexagonal Bell Tower and Hexagonal Stele Pavilion:

Located to the left and right rear of the tower.

The Hexagonal Bell Tower houses the largest bell in Hue (weighing approximately 2 tons), cast in 1710.

The Hexagonal Stele Pavilion houses a stone stele made in 1715, resting on the back of a giant marble turtle, a symbol of longevity.

Dai Hùng Hall (Đại Hùng Hall):

This is the main hall of the temple, housing a triad of Buddhas.
Location and View:

Perched on a hill overlooking the romantic Perfume River, the temple's beautiful scenery is one of its attractions.

Historical Role:

During the Vietnam War, this temple served as a base for protests against the Ngo Dinh Diem regime's oppression of Buddhism. In particular, the car used by monk Thich Quang Duc, who set himself on fire in Saigon in 1963, during his protests is on display within the temple grounds.

This temple is an essential stop on any visit to Hue, offering a chance to experience its historical significance, beautiful architecture, and tranquil atmosphere. Admission is free."

ChIJ0wVgLJemQTERunn1THqLJvc,"The Thiên Mụ Pagoda (meaning ""Pagoda of the Celestial Lady""), also known as Linh Mụ in some historical periods, is perhaps the most iconic and spiritual symbol of the city of Hue, Vietnam.
Here is the most relevant information about this historic pagoda:
1. History and Legend
* Foundation: It was founded in 1601 by Nguyễn Hoàng, the first Nguyễn lord of the Đàng Trong region (South Vietnam), making it the oldest pagoda in the former imperial capital.
* The Legend: Its name is based on a folk legend. It is said that Nguyễn Hoàng rode a horse along the Perfume River in search of a place to establish his dynasty. Upon arriving at Ha Khê Hill, the locals told him the story of an old woman dressed in red (the Celestial Lady) who appeared and prophesied that a great lord would build a temple there, where the spirit of the nation would be concentrated. Upon hearing this, Nguyễn Hoàng ordered the construction of the pagoda and named it Thiên Mụ (Heavenly Lady).
2. Architecture and Features
* Location: Located on Ha Khê Hill, on the left bank of the Perfume River, about 5 km from downtown Hue. Its location by the river is very poetic and contributes to its serene atmosphere.
* Phước Duyên Tower (Fountain of Happiness): This is the pagoda's most iconic structure.
* It was built in 1844 by Emperor Thiệu Trị.
* It has seven levels (floors), each dedicated to a different Buddha.
* It is 21 meters tall and has an octagonal floor plan.
* Building Complex: The pagoda is a complex that includes:
* The Tam Quan entrance gate (triple gate).
* The Dai Hung Hall, the main hall that houses Buddha statues (including Maitreya Buddha).
* A stele (engraved stone slab) atop a large marble turtle, a symbol of longevity.
3. Historical and Cultural Significance
* Royal Patronage: Over the centuries, the pagoda was sponsored and expanded by various emperors of the Nguyen Dynasty, solidifying its status as an important Buddhist center and architectural treasure.
* Political Significance: In modern history, the pagoda gained international prominence by housing the car (a turquoise Austin) used by monk Thich Quang Duc to travel to Saigon, where he set himself on fire in 1963 in protest against the South Vietnamese regime. This event brought worldwide attention to the plight of Buddhists.
Today, Thiên Mụ Pagoda remains an active Buddhist monastery, attracting thousands of pilgrims and tourists for its nostalgic beauty, peaceful space, and profound cultural significance."

ChIJe2d00l2hQTERcpaIXwDL7i4,"Nice little escape from the city. I was the only one on the mountain and had a good time.

Follow the street that someone else in the review section mentioned with a screenshot of maps. It’s a 15 min steep climb. I have done it in flip flops, which doable but I would wear normal shoes next time.

When you are on top, you can just follow the track and descend on the other site of the mountain. You will end up in a cemetery and will have to find your way to a small road just in front of the cemetery. Then turn right and right again, walk 100m and on your left side you will find a huge monument of à former Vietnamese general, quite impressive.

Next to the monument you will find stairs that go up a little hill, follow the stairs, go down again on the other side and then you will find the grave of ho chi minhs mother"

ChIJe2d00l2hQTERcpaIXwDL7i4,"The perfect mountain for beginners to climb. It took me about 10 minutes to climb all the way from the foot of the mountain to the top. Because there is a pre-existing path, you can just climb up, but the road is quite steep and dangerous. Remember to wear shoes with good adhesion to avoid falling due to slipping. Climbing up is easy, but going down is quite overwhelming for those who are not used to it. Since the reign of King Gia Long, this mountain was chosen as a criminal record, a natural screen shielding the Hue citadel, meaning to protect the prosperity of the dynasty. More specifically, King Gia Long ordered each mandarin to plant a pine tree on the mountain, creating a vast green pine forest that is still a symbol of Ngu Binh today. Standing on the top, you can see the beautiful panorama of Hue below"

ChIJe2d00l2hQTERcpaIXwDL7i4,"The pictures show a place that is next to the hill, not on the hill, follow the road around the hill to find the place with the status.

ChIJe2d00l2hQTERcpaIXwDL7i4,Very special
ChIJe2d00l2hQTERcpaIXwDL7i4,"Along with the Perfume River, Ngu Binh Mountain is a wonderful symbol of Hue. Therefore, Ngu Binh is gradually becoming an ideal destination for tourists who love nature and want to enjoy the fresh air. Ngu Binh Mountain is located about 3km from the south bank of the Perfume River, in the former location of Tu Tay Hamlet, An Cuu Village; then Thuy An Commune, Hue City; now An Cuu Ward of the city. Although this mountain is only 104m high, because it rises suddenly in the middle of flat land, in a special position, since the 17th century, it has been in the sights and caught the eye of Hue urban planners and builders. Indeed, in its history and geography books, the National History Institute of the Nguyen Dynasty clearly recorded that in 1687, when Lord Nguyen Phuc Thai moved the capital from Kim Long to Phu Xuan Village, the architects at that time used this special mountain as a screen, a feng shui element in ancient architecture. At that time, it was called Hon Mo or Bang Son. Bang is a very large bird, like an eagle for example. The reason for the name Bang Son is because the mountain looks like an eagle spreading its wings to fly. This is a natural mountain, but from the north, it looks balanced, the two wings on the east and west sides are symmetrical to each other evenly as if they were built and shaped by human hands. Moreover, the two slopes on both sides of the mountain slightly protrude forward, looking like two arms spreading forward to welcome someone. The beauty of Ngu mountain is not in the feng shui aspect of protecting Hue citadel, the beauty of Ngu mountain is that it is close to the people of Hue, it becomes a platform, a towering building and going up there on artificial steps, people can stretch their eyes to admire the gentle beauty of Hue citadel, listen to the echoes from far below, and feel like they are in some other world, otherworldly."

ChIJSZ8W806hQTER6MKlPCF2_b4,"The most ancient and sacred pagoda in the ancient capital of Hue is Tu Dam Pagoda. Founded by Zen Master Minh Hoang Tu Dung in the late 17th century with the original name An Ton, the pagoda was renamed Tu Dam by King Thieu Tri in 1841, meaning ""good clouds"", symbolizing purity and compassion. With more than 300 years of history, this place is not only a Buddhist center but also a valuable cultural heritage of Vietnam. The architecture of Tu Dam Pagoda delicately blends classical and modern features. The tiled gate with sturdy stone steps opens the way to the airy campus, where there is an ancient Bodhi tree, grafted from the Bodhi tree in India in 1936, providing peaceful shade. Here is the 27m high An Ton Stupa with 7 floors, it is said that inside each floor is a bronze Buddha statue, creating a solemn and unique beauty. The main hall was rebuilt in 2006 in the style of the Hue royal palace, the surrounding space is filled with the scent of incense, very pleasant, inside is a statue of Buddha Shakyamuni and two statues of Bodhisattva Manjushri and Samantabhadra. Behind the main hall is the Ancestor's house, where the 28th Zen master Bodhidharma, the Zen master Minh Hoang Tu Dung and his successors are worshiped, showing respect for Buddhist traditions. Next to it is a souvenir room like a small museum, displaying historical relics, helping people understand more about the development of the pagoda. This is one of the pagodas to visit when coming to Hue because of the long history of Buddhist development, and the value of the historical stories it brings."

ChIJSZ8W806hQTER6MKlPCF2_b4,"Từ Đàm Pagoda in Huế is one of the most peaceful and spiritually significant places I’ve ever visited. Nestled in the heart of the ancient imperial city, this pagoda is not only a place of worship but also a cultural and historical landmark that reflects the deep roots of Vietnamese Buddhism.

What makes Từ Đàm Pagoda especially meaningful to me is the legacy of one of its most revered monks: Venerable Thích Trí Quang. I have long admired him for his intellect, his dedication to Buddhism, and especially his work translating and interpreting many important Buddhist texts into Vietnamese. His influence on Vietnamese Buddhism, both in spiritual and cultural terms, is profound. Though he has passed away, his spirit and teachings are very much alive in this sacred space. It was incredibly moving to walk through the grounds and know that this was a place he once walked, taught, and meditated.

The pagoda itself is beautiful — quiet, clean, and filled with the scent of incense. The architecture is traditional yet timeless, with a large main hall, well-tended gardens, and statues that inspire a deep sense of calm and reverence. The monks and caretakers are kind and respectful, and there is a genuine atmosphere of compassion and wisdom here.

If you are in Huế and seeking a meaningful spiritual experience — or simply want a quiet space to reflect — I highly recommend visiting Từ Đàm Pagoda. For me, it was more than a visit; it was a moment of connection with history, faith, and the legacy of a great teacher."

ChIJSZ8W806hQTER6MKlPCF2_b4,"Tu Dam Pagoda is a famous ancient pagoda in Hue, currently located at 1 Su Lieu Quan Street, Truong An Ward, Thuan Hoa District, Hue City, Vietnam.

History
The pagoda was founded by Zen Master Minh Hoang - Tu Dung[1] around the end of the 17th century, and was later named An Ton Pagoda (印宗寺, or Tong), meaning ""taking the transmission of the mind as the main principle""[2].

In 1702, monk Lieu Quan (later also a high monk) came to the pagoda, asking to study with Zen Master Minh Hoang - Tu Dung[3]

In 1703, Zen Master Minh Hoang - Tu Dung restored the pagoda. Also in this year, Lord Nguyen Phuc Chu granted the pagoda the Sac Tu An Ton Tu plaque. After the Master passed away, according to his will, his student Zen Master Thiet Vinh - Buu Hanh became the abbot of the pagoda.

In 1802, the Tay Son dynasty was overthrown. At that time, due to time and war, An Ton Pagoda was severely damaged like many other pagodas in the region [4]. However, it was not until the 12th year of Gia Long (1813) that Zen Master Dao Trung - Trong Nghia was able to organize the restoration of the pagoda [5]. 

In 1841, King Thieu Tri changed the name of An Ton Pagoda to Tu Dam-慈曇寺 (to avoid the taboo of the king's name Mien Tong) [5], meaning ""the auspicious cloud of Buddhism"" [6]. 

In the 9th year of Thanh Thai (1897), the king ordered the road to Nam Giao altar to be opened. Because this road passed through the grounds of Tu Dam Pagoda, the king ordered the abbot, Zen Master Thanh Hiep - Tuong Van, to move the 5 stupas containing the remains of the ancestors to the grounds of Bao Quoc Pagoda nearby. Perhaps on this occasion, the abbot had the pagoda restored again [7]. 

From the 1920s onwards, the Vietnamese Buddhist revival movement developed in all three regions. During that time, Tu Dam Pagoda was the center of the Central Buddhist Revival Movement[8].

In 1932, the An Nam Buddhist Association (later renamed the Central Vietnamese Buddhist Association) was established in Hue... In 1936, the Lam Te sect agreed to hand over Tu Dam Pagoda to the association as a place of worship and as the association's headquarters.

On December 18, 1938, the Thua Thien Provincial Buddhist Association had Tu Dam Pagoda extensively renovated, and at the same time cast a statue of Buddha Shakyamuni and other Dharma instruments to enshrine in the main hall, which was completed in 1940. Other items such as lecture halls, monks' quarters and some offices of the Provincial Association were also built during that time[9].

In 1943, the Gia Dinh Phat Hoa Pho was established; In 1951, it was renamed the Buddhist Family, and its headquarters was located at Tu Dam Pagoda[10].

In 1951, the Congress to establish the Vietnam Buddhist Sangha took place at the pagoda.

In 1951, the Conference to establish the Vietnam Buddhist Sangha (including 51 delegates from 6 groups of monks and lay people in the three regions) was also held here. At that time, the Association also approved the Most Venerable To Lien to sign on behalf of the Association to join the World Buddhist Association.

In the 1960s, Tu Dam Pagoda was the center of activities to fight against the religious policy under President Ngo Dinh Diem.

Currently, the pagoda has the office of the Hue City Buddhist Executive Committee."

Thank you and I hope to see you again a second time."
ChIJ0RRZRyahQTERi3rKTb8kpsQ,The ancient temple dates back to the reign of King Thieu Tri. The space and trees are very cool and worth visiting.
ChIJ0RRZRyahQTERi3rKTb8kpsQ,"As one of the three remaining national temples from the Nguyen Dynasty, it bears the historical and spiritual cultural imprints of the ancient capital. Dieu De Pagoda is located in a prime location, surrounded by four roads, with the most prominent being the front facing Ho Thanh River, creating a peaceful and airy scene. The temple space is spacious, surrounded by lush green trees, bringing a cool feeling. The continuous chanting of sutras, mixed with incense smoke, makes people's hearts calm down, finding a rare peace. Built in 1844 under the reign of King Thieu Tri, the pagoda was originally the king's palace when he was still a prince. According to the Nguyen Dynasty's records, King Thieu Tri built the pagoda on the old palace foundation to pray for the people, and conferred the title of National Pagoda, naming it ""Dieu De"" meaning the wonder of culture and Buddhism. Through the ups and downs of history, especially after the fall of the capital in 1885, the pagoda was occupied and many structures were damaged. However, thanks to several restorations, most notably the major restoration in 1953 supported by Lady Tu Cung (mother of King Bao Dai), the pagoda still retains its ancient features and profound spiritual values. The pagoda played an important role in the Buddhist movement of the 1930s and the struggle for religious equality in 1963. Every year, the pagoda often organizes a Buddha procession on the occasion of Buddha's birthday, attracting thousands of monks, nuns and Buddhists. The architecture of Dieu De pagoda bears the strong style of the Nguyen Dynasty's royal court, although it has changed over time. Initially, the pagoda had a surrounding wall, four symmetrical doors symbolizing the Four Holy Emperors, along with structures such as Dai Giac palace, Dao Nguyen pavilion, communal house, and bi dinh. Today, the main hall has been rebuilt in the style of a wooden house, with 18 precious wooden statues of Arhats on both sides. Inside, the ceiling painting ""Long Van Khe Hoi"" is preserved, the largest masterpiece in Vietnam, depicting five dragons hidden in the clouds, made by the royal artist Phan Van Tanh. The four pillars in the hall are carved with elaborate dragons and clouds, showing the fusion between royal and folk art. Outside, there are two Dai Hong Chung bells cast in 1846, the pride of the pagoda. One is placed in Chung Dinh near Tam Quan gate, the other in the bell tower to the right of Dai Giac hall, used in major ceremonies. The two-story Tam Quan gate, Ho Phap tower, and the hundred-year-old Bodhi tree are also highlights not to be missed when visiting the pagoda."

ChIJ0RRZRyahQTERi3rKTb8kpsQ,"Dieu De Pagoda is one of three national pagodas still existing in Hue city, maintaining precious cultural and spiritual values. Located on the banks of Ho Thanh River, near Gia Hoi Bridge, the pagoda is located at 100B Bach Dang Street, Phu Cat Ward. The space around the pagoda is spacious and peaceful, creating a sense of relaxation for those who come to visit and pray. With elegant architecture and poetic landscape, Dieu De Pagoda is considered one of the most sacred places in Hue. Dieu De Pagoda was originally the place where King Thieu Tri's palace was located and was also the king's birthplace in 1907. In 1844, the king mobilized 600 soldiers to build a pagoda on the old palace's foundation on a large scale, using the Dao Dong Ba River as the main hall and establishing the national pagoda. When the capital fell in 1885, King Ham Nghi moved the Buddha statues from Giac Hoang Pagoda to worship at Dieu De Pagoda. Later, the Southern Dynasty used the temple buildings as the headquarters of the Thua Thien government. Many rows of buildings in the temple were destroyed in 1887. In 1889, King Thanh Thai gave the monk Thanh Minh - Tam Truyen 3,000 quan of money to restore the temple, but it could not be completely restored as before. 

The architecture of Dieu De Pagoda clearly reflects the traditional Vietnamese style with curved tiled roofs and intricately carved wooden pillars. The temple was built in the style of an ancient house, creating a feeling of closeness and warmth for visitors. Inside the temple, the meditation rooms and worship spaces are meticulously designed, bringing serenity and peace. The decorative motifs on the walls and ceilings show the ingenuity and creativity of the artisans of that period. 
The temple grounds are spacious, including many different areas such as meditation gardens, small lakes and winding paths. Each small structure in the campus has its own meaning, contributing to the overall harmony and elegance. The windows and main doors are made of high-quality wood, allowing natural light to enter, creating a warm and pleasant space. 

The National Temple of Dieu De Pagoda today still retains its ancient and sacred beauty as the first day of construction. The National Temple was built of bricks and stones, with delicate carvings on the pillars and roof. This place is often used to organize important festivals and religious ceremonies, attracting a large number of believers and tourists. The space inside the National Temple is simply but fully decorated, creating a solemn and peaceful feeling. 

When coming to Dieu De Pagoda, you definitely cannot miss visiting the outstanding structures inside the temple grounds. First is the large Buddha statue located in the center of the temple, with impressive size and sophisticated sculptural details. The Buddha statue is placed on a high stone pedestal, creating solemnity and majesty, attracting the eyes of all visitors. The presence of the large Buddha statue brings a sense of serenity and peace to all visitors."

ChIJ0RRZRyahQTERi3rKTb8kpsQ,"Diệu Đế Pagoda is one of the national pagodas with a long history and unique architecture in Hue. Based on the information I found, my impression of this pagoda is as follows:

Regarding history and culture: Diệu Đế Pagoda holds an important position in the history of Buddhism in Hue, being one of the three pagodas that were declared ""national pagodas"" by Emperor Thiệu Trị and directly patronized by the Nguyễn Dynasty. This demonstrates the pagoda's rich history and profound cultural value. Coming here, you can feel the solemnity and sacredness of an ancient pagoda that has witnessed many ups and downs of the history of the Citadel.

Regarding architecture: Diệu Đế Pagoda impresses with its unique architecture, different from many other pagodas in Hue. It is famous for the ""Nine Dragons Hidden in Clouds"" painting, the largest of its kind in Vietnam. The pagoda's campus is spacious, shaded by green trees, creating a cool and peaceful feeling. Structures such as the Great Awakening Hall (điện Đại Giác), Đạo Nguyên Pavilion (Đạo Nguyên các), Wisdom Room (phòng Trí Tuệ), and Auspicious House (nhà Cát Tường) are harmoniously arranged, bearing the imprint of ancient imperial architecture. In particular, the pagoda also has four low towers at the main gate and two on either side of the main hall, creating a distinctive beauty.

Regarding experience: When you set foot in Diệu Đế Pagoda, you will feel the serene and peaceful atmosphere. This is not only a place of spiritual activities for monks and nuns but also a destination attracting tourists who want to learn about the Buddhist culture, history, and architecture of Hue. Strolling through the pagoda grounds, admiring the ancient buildings, and listening to the sound of the pagoda bell, you can find peace in your soul.

In summary, Diệu Đế Pagoda is a worthwhile destination to experience in Hue, where you can discover distinctive historical and cultural values and find tranquility in the peaceful space of an ancient temple."

Dieu De Pagoda (妙諦寺) is located on the bank of Ho Thanh River, which Hue people call Gia Hoi River, or Dong Ba River, now at 100B Bach Dang Street, near Gia Hoi Bridge. Dieu De Pagoda, along with Thien Mu Pagoda and Thanh Duyen Pagoda, are the three national pagodas of the Nguyen Dynasty that still exist today.

Dieu De Pagoda is not as ""magnificent"" as Bai Dinh or Tam Chuc Pagoda or modern pagodas across the country later, but there is ""Buddha"" in the pagoda. Dieu De is considered one of the three national pagodas of the ancient capital of Hue. They are Thien Mu Pagoda, Dieu De Pagoda and Thanh Duyen Pagoda.
Dieu De Pagoda was built by King Thieu Tri in the 4th year in 1844. The pagoda is located on the bank of Ho Thanh River, which Hue people call Gia Hoi River, or Dong Ba River. In the main hall, there is a worship of Tam The Buddha, and on both sides are statues of Maitreya, originally from the reign of King Thieu Tri. The Buddha and Arhat statues here all have simple, symbolic lines, few colors or elaborate lines, although Hue is the cradle of fine arts, music and cuisine. Dieu De is an ancient and sacred pagoda, so all year round there are always people from the North and the South making pilgrimages to burn incense."

There are several stops along the way, including a waterfall where you can swim, lunch at a beach restaurant that serves delicious seafood, and a tour of Da Nang, passing by the Buddha Lady.
I highly recommend it!"

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"This trip was amazing. First I was a little afraid to get on the bike but Duyen helped me and said ‘relax lady’. So i did. Off we went! We swan in waterfalls, eat Fresh chicken and walked the bamboo. Very safe, very nice, very professional and sooooo friendly. Highly recommend it. Everyone should do it.
If you wanna do the hai van pass, just like on Top Gear; do do it with them. The bikes are so comfortabel and so safe."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"One of my favourite experiences in Vietnam. The most lovely driver, who have so much energy. You can go with them to do the hai van pass, see waterfall, have lunch; just overall the best day ever. So good that I have already done it with them twice already!! If you are gonna do the hai van pass do it with them. You will see so many cool things from their comfortable moterbikes."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Incredible experience from start to finish. We felt very safe on the bikes and they had the comfiest seats of any bike tour we've done in Asia. We had an amazing lunch at the waterfall with super fresh food, they even stopped to buy us fresh shrimp from the local market on the way. Our bags were safely delivered to our hostel in Hoi An before we arrived and we were collected from our hostel in Hue on time in the morning. Amazing day, amazing views, amazing drivers, we have already recommended this trip to our friends. Also very easy to book via WhatsApp, we were very last minute and booked the day before our trip!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We did the high van pass to Hoi An and had an amazing time! The guide was really kind and even showed us a magic trick! The bikes were very comfy, much needed after doing the Ha Giang Loop. Would definitely recommend"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Amazing experience! Duyen was great from the beginning and gave me all the information I needed to know before I booked. This tour includes the pass, your own bikes or an easy rider, an amazing fresh seafood lunch at Lan Co Beach, swim in a great waterfall, tour through beautiful local rice fields, villages, farms and temples and a visit to the marble temples. Though the tour doesn’t allow enough time to go to the top off marble mountains, only enough time to access one cave. The pass itself was stunning but the tours through local and tucked away landscapes was just as breathtaking. Duyen was very kind, informative and helpful! The gas isn’t included in price but overall was great value and well worth it. Overall was an awesome adventure and a great insight into the local beauty of Hue!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Had such a great day! Duyen was amazing at taking me and my friend along Hai van pass. I don’t have a bike license but he made me feel at ease and was always there in front checking on us throughout. The seafood restaurant we went to was soooo good as well! Such a good amount of stops along the way like the waterfalls, ducks, sugarcane juice and rice fields!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"The ride was amazing. The drivers are experienced, funny and really kind. It was my first time doing something like this and I couldn't hope for something better. We went to the waterfall to have lunch and it was the perfect break.
We felt really safe (we are 2 girls 22 and 25 years old) and welcomed. Definitely suggest it!!!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Amazing experience with our riders! They picked us up in front of our homestay, they secured our luggage and then we hopped on the motorbikes. Since we are not experienced drivers we let them drive for us. The drivers were super safe and kind, they stopped multiple times to let us take wonderful pictures. The bike was large and comfortable. We also stopped by a waterfall and they offered us a delicious lunch. I could not ask for more!

Ps: I went with a friend of mine and we both felt super safe as female travelers."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"10/10 company to use for the Hai Van Pass!! We got recommended this company from a previous hostel - so glad we did! The company were happy to accommodate all my friends (we were a group of 10) with some using easy riders and others riding solo. The easy riders were very good and we felt safe, and the bikes for those going solo were in really good condition. The team took us to a waterfall and some viewpoints. They also took us to a really nice seafood restaurant by the beach for lunch and also treated us all to a beer at the end. The day was really well organised and was one of the highlights of Vietnam!!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Duyen is the best!! I did a three day, two night trip from Phong Nha to Hoi An, along the Ho Chi Minh Trail and through the Hai Van Pass. Duyen is an amazing driver and as a solo female traveller, I felt safe the entire time. He always took the more scenic route which added to the experience and he had excellent local recommendations for food. My luggage was also delivered to my accomodation on time with no issue. Highly recommend ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We went from hue to hoi an with the motorbikes - our suitcases were pocked up from our hotel in hue and brought directly to our hotel in hoi an, which was amazing! we did a nice trip, started a bit earlier (8am) because we needed to be in hoi an at 14:30. this was good, as we were on the stops before many others - for example swam in the waterfall with just 2 other people and saq the wonderful pass. all in all a great experience and an amazing lunch which was vegetarian for us! :)  drivers are experienced and drive safely, motorbikes are bigger than the normal scooters, so you have something to lean on, which is comfy."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We had the best time with Duyen, he went above and beyond making us feel safe and have a great day being our guide through the Hai Van pass, the bikes provided were great, he showed us the best spots, including the waterfall, beach and best viewpoint stops, we can’t thank him enough, he made the whole experience so enjoyable, I would 100% recommend amazing easy riders as it’s a smaller business, with the nicest owner!!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"The best day I’ve had in a long time!! I tell you book this now, you will not regret it. Stunning views, vibes and magic tricks. What an experience"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"I recommend, did the Hai Van Pass from Hué to Hoi An and we had a wonderful day. Duyen is a super nice guy and make everything for you to have it perfect."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"This was such amazing trip. Had such a good time for Hai van Pass trip Top Gear  in Vietnam. He was very professional and also safe,I highly recommend if you are not feeling so comfortable riding in Vietnam because of the traffic.
The food and tickets also included in the price

Advice:you should book online and not on the street as it may not be an easy rider contacting you. Because when I walked in Hué city some people tried to make me hire them as an easy rider and they were not.
They also said that they was brother to John Duyên and they are not.
I was so happy to do the Easy rider with him,i never forgot the trip, i will tell to my friends that, Thank you so much John Duyen"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"My motorbike tour with Duyen was absolutely incredible. A friend recommended him and he was wonderful. Duyen was kind, supportive and made me feel very safe at all times. He was informative and we stopped many times to have breaks, photos and to show me the sights. I had a lot of fun seeing the Hai Van Pass, the countryside and the beautiful rice fields with Duyen. I highly recommend this trip to everyone 🙂"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"I had an amazing time with Duyen, I was recommended to go with him by a friend who took the tour with him a couple of years ago, and I’m very glad that I did.

I am a solo female traveller, and he made me feel very comfortable and was great company along the way. He told me lots of interesting information at our stops and made sure to remind me to top up my suncream (I’m very pale!). He made sure that I got lots of photos, including with me in them. We had a lovely lunch at a seafood place, the food was really fresh and he picked out some dishes for me that he thought I would like - and they were delicious.

Before I even arrived he was really kind and helpful, sending me advice about Hue and safety tips.

I don’t have much experience on a motorbike but he was a very good and safe driver so I felt totally comfortable and had a lot of fun. The ride was great, I really enjoyed the views and I would really recommend this tour to anyone."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"I am a solo female traveler and couldn’t have asked for better company to do that Hai Van pass with.

I felt safe all while having fun with Duyen as he showed me multiple different spots along the way as well as being a great personal photographer which means a lot when you are by yourself.

Great communication through WhatsApp and even advice before I arrived in Hue about safety in the busy areas, it was greatly appreciated and shows Duyen goes above and beyond for his clients.

Delicious food is included in the tour with Duyen giving you the option of what you would like and then taking you to a great restaurant for that food.

Very safe driving and it is an incredibly convenient way of transporting your bag to your destination in Hoi An in their private van.

It was a great day that I would recommend to any other solo traveller or group. I thoroughly enjoyed myself and hope this review convinces others to have a brilliant day in Vietnam on the Hai Van pass."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Nice little trip form hoi an to hue! Duyen drove my mother and then my sister while I was driving behind. We did some very nice stops and had a very good meel. And of course the driving was very safe:)! Thanks a lot!

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Had a wonderful day with brothers Duyen and Hu going from Da Nang to Hue. Felt absolutely safe and comfortable with them. They are complete professionals at driving and rest assured they made no blind passes or any other dangerous moves. We were treated to a delicious lunch and plenty of stops to rest and take photos. Plus, many other easy riders after the Hai Van pass just take you straight down the highway, but Duyen and Hue took us down side roads to see the beautiful rice fields and Vietnamese countryside. Absolutely recommend these guys, you will have an amazing time!!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"I had the best just the best day with Duyen and Huu riding from Da Nang to Hue! It was my first trip with an easy rider but I felt so safe and comfortable (even with my giant rucksack strapped to the back of the bike)!

Driving down the Hai Van Pass was so much fun and so beautiful! There were so many great stops along the way - I think my favourites were the marble mountain and waterfall - and Duyen and Huu acted as both driver, tour guide and photographer. We also had the most fabulous lunch.

I could not recommend them though!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Great tour with many highlights (waterfall, food on the beach, Cloud Pass, Monkey Island) and stops during the tour!
John is 100% reliable and punctual and he and his people are very safe drivers. An absolute recommendation!!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We had an amazing ride from Hue to Hoi an with Duyen, Ky and Rone. They were so friendly and Duyen had lots of knowledge of the local area- even recommended a great tailor in Hoi an.
Was easy to book and reliable, also had our luggage transferred by van with no issues. Definitely recommend. Thank you!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"What a wonderful day trip (Hoi An - Hue) this was. A stunningly beautiful route. My easyrider, Duyen, stopped at several locations so I could fully enjoy it. For example, at the Marple Mountains, waterfalls, and a beautiful beach. My backpack was securely strapped to the back, but I could have chosen to have it transported by car. But that worked out perfectly. Duyen is a lovely, calm man. He also drove calmly and safely. The lunch was delicious and in a truly beautiful location. The last stretch we rode through the rice paddies with the sunset. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
In a word: RECOMMENDED!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We rented motorbikes from these guys and self drove from Hue to Hoi An. It was the best and the craziest time of our Vietnam trip so far! Would recommend to everyone! :)

Motorbikes collection went all smooth and quick and the motorbikes themselves were in great condition."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Great experience, the bike worked a dream and was perfect for navigating the Hai Van Pass from Hue to Hoi An, full tank handled all the driving and sight seeing along the way. John and his family were so welcoming and friendly. Thoroughly recommend!"

Took us on a great route with beautiful scenery and stops along the way while never rushing us to get back on the bikes. Delicious lunch by a beautiful waterfall.

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"The tour was great. We didn't follow the main route, so we saw some beautiful scenery and animals. The pass itself offers a beautiful view and is definitely recommended!
We had a wonderful day with Johnny. He's very knowledgeable, and you can tell it's important to him that you see a lot and have a great and safe tour."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Duyen was extremely patient and helpful throughout. We had dinner with him at a place he recommended the night before, and got to taste the local cuisine. He was flexible to our needs, and fun to hang out with."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Ok
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Where do I start… The lovely John was our guide for the Hai Van pass and boy did he deliver! He was able to take us on stunning back roads that we wouldn’t have found ourselves and delivered non-stop vibes. John is an all round legend and would 100% recommend going to him for rentals, tours and beers!!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Beautiful experience! Duyen took me on a journey to discover the real Vietnam through rice paddies, lagoons and enchanting landscapes. Several stops along the way, excellent lunch, safe and careful driving. Highly recommended!"

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,We found this amazing man who has let us enjoy the most amazing trip. He was super helpful and went above and beyond what he was providing for us (including taking me to the eye doctors). This man is so lovely and chooses the best route for the Hi Van Pass with scenic views and amazing stop offs on beaches with no tourists. Would 100% recommend booking with him 🫶
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Brilliant experience, we went to the most magical beach and got shown the most extraordinary views, our easy riders were very safe, but what we really loved was how friendly and kind they all were.
This tour was one of best not far behind the ha Giang loop, it was a great day out and I am very grateful.
The lunch stop was so much fun and the food was authentic and delicious, the waterfall was also spectacular!!!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,We had the best day ever !!! John took us on paths that not many people know about so we got to see rural parts of the Vietnamese countryside and rice fields! The easy riders were all so nice and the bikes were so so comfortable! We went to a lovely waterfall and an empty beach and many lovely viewpoints! Lunch was delicious too 😊😊 best day defo recommend 🔥🔥
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We had an amazing experience with Amazing Easy Riders, riding from Hoi An to Hue.
They picked us up from our accommodation and the trip was great. They took us to lots of photo spots away from the main tourist spots, we drove through amazing rice fields with only us around, the stop off at the waterfall with lunch was amazing.
A really incredible experience with the nicest guides, thank you to Duyen and Thuy. Couldn’t recommend them more!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Such a great experience for the Hai Van Pass. After the pass we were taken through amazing back roads, rice paddies and villages with plenty of stops to take photos. The lunch stop at the waterfall was great too."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,The guide was very friendly. We had great food. Beautiful trip through nature. Highly recommend!
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"I had an incredible time doing the Hai Van Pass from Hue to Hoi An with Johnny and Ky! I booked on WhatsApp with Ky, who has great English, and had super quick responses. We started with a lovely drive through rice fields to a waterfall where we swam, jumped & slid in! The highlight of this section of the road was the super cute ducklings!!! After going in the waterfall they provided us with plastic bags for our wet stuff which was very thoughtful. We then had a very good lunch - mountain chicken, morning glory, omelette and rice! We then continued driving and stopped at the beach for a wander and Johnny’s very funny magic card trick!!! The Hai Van Pass itself was beautiful and we stopped at lots of viewpoints for amazing photos!!! We also saw monkeys and stopped at a pagoda with a huge Buddha before continuing through Da Nang to Hoi An. I am so glad I was recommended these amazing guys from friends I met during my travels as it was an amazing day! Special shoutout to my easy rider Johnny who had incredible English and was so funny and chatty!!! I will remember this day for a long time - it definitely stands out as one of my favourite days in over 6 months travelling!!!"

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We had a fantastic day with the amazing Easy Riders! Everything was very smooth and seemed very organized. We never rode for longer than 40 minutes and made plenty of stops for sightseeing and taking pictures. We were only a small group of four, which was very pleasant. The Easy Riders went out of their way to give us a great day. We'll especially remember the lunch! We've never eaten such good seafood. Thank you for the fantastic day; we can definitely recommend the tour without reservation :))"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Really good day on the ha van pass Duyen/John was brilliant easy rider and absolutely made our trip!
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We had an amazing day with the easy riders. Stopped off for multiple nice viewpoints, saw the family farm within the rice fields, played bowls with the locals and then football with some local students. Very worth it and much better than getting a bus or grab from each location. Our riders made us feel very safe and comfortable on the back of the bikes. Was one of the best days in vietnam we have had!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Amazing drivers, played games at their house, and football with local kids, highly recommend"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Very fun day riding from Hue to Hoi An. Felt very safe with our riders, they took us though back roads rather than the highway out of Hue which was really interesting. It was raining but that didn't matter as they were well prepared with ponchos, trousers and shoe covers. Lunch was very tasty. Pick up and drop off at accommodation also very smooth. Would recommend!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Great tour! Our guides Ky and his brother were really accomodating and kind. Beautiful ride not just the hai can pass but also through the country side of Hue. Highly recommend this tour!

Thanks"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Very full and friendly day with this team! Stopped at many spots to take photos, we took small roads in the countryside and in the middle of the rice fields rather than the highway, it was magnificent! Thank you again for this great day with funny and interesting guides! We ate well, laughed a lot, and really enjoyed this adventure!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"An incredible experience with this warm, welcoming, cheerful, funny, and accommodating team!

The motorbike drivers were very professional and friendly.
A smooth and safe ride!
Faster than a taxi ride and much more unforgettable.
I highly recommend it. Even with large luggage, there was no problem; they were transported by van, arriving directly at our accommodation in Hue.
Breathtaking scenery and delicious food!
Don't hesitate 👌"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We had a fantastic experience with three friends and our easy riders, John and Ky.
We felt safe on the motorbikes from the start and visited some beautiful places between Hoi An and Hue.

They did everything they could to make our experience as enjoyable as possible.

I would highly recommend it to everyone. The trip is fantastic, and the drivers make it even more enjoyable.
So don't hesitate!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"A wonderful day of motorcycling between Hue and Hoi An. Perfectly organized. With Duyen and his group, you'll enjoy the Vietnamese countryside in the best possible way, from rice paddies to waterfalls and heavenly beaches, all at a very ""holiday"" pace. In short, we had a truly wonderful day; it's a nice change from taking the bus to reach these two cities!
Thank you so much!!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We had a great day with Duyen and Huu. We were able to visit fishing villages, swim in a waterfall and a heavenly beach, without forgetting the multiple viewpoints. The driving team was very friendly and took great care of us. I highly recommend!"

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"It was a beautiful drive from Hue to Hoi An. John was very talkative and picked out quiet spots. A great recommendation, and very affordable if you're planning to do the Haivan Pass."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We met John at the train station exit to head to our hotel, and that was the start of two excellent days. We took advantage of his advice to visit Hue easily and quickly, and at unbeatable prices. He shared his experiences as a former tour guide in very understandable English.
We shared a meal at his home, prepared by his wife, which was delicious.
And we chose to tour Hue and Hoi An with him by motorbike, which wasn't our first choice.
But what a discovery! The team of drivers is professional and friendly. The route is magnificent, with a magnificent view, a beautiful beach, a temple, explanations all along the way, and a clean waterfall. We always felt safe, confident, and well received thanks to him.
Go for it!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Best experience ever! 100% recommend! John and kye are very kind and helpfull!
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"I nearly didnt do a tour but so glad i did! I drove myself but two people i met took the easy rider option and we all had a great time. We were taken on some small roads through the countryside which was lovely and the Hai Van pass itself has incredible views.

We stopped at a waterfall for a refreshing swim, a beach for a seafood lunch, the big lady buddha statue in da nang and a couple of viewpoints for photos.

Kai and John were both great guys and very funny which made the trip even more enjoyable. Would definitely recommend this to anyone thinking about doing the Hai Van pass!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Our trip with Duyen and his partner was fantastic. We felt safe at all times, and it was a very enjoyable trip with lots of laughter and good vibes.

They even gave us a gift."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"What an unforgettable experience! We spent a great day with Duyen (John) and his team, who were very friendly. The visit to the waterfall was perfect for cooling off. The bikes were comfortable, and we felt very safe and relaxed throughout the trip. The views from Hai Van Pass were stunning, and we enjoyed the freshest seafood at a phenomenal restaurant right by the ocean. It's definitely the best way to travel between Hue and Hoi An. We highly recommend this tour with Amazing Easy Riders!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,The whole experience was amazing Duyen was very safe and stop to take lots of photo and all keep points. This isn't just transport but a high quality day trip. We even added on a stop at the abandoned water park.

John is the BEST!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Best tour of our trip!

My fiancée and I had an incredible day with John. He took us on the back roads from Hoi An to Hue. We made many stops along the way. We viewed the marble cliffs, crossed the impressive Cloud Pass (Hai Van), and went swimming at a waterfall. After swimming, we also had dinner together there. It was fantastic!
We drove the rest of the way to Hue along the edge of the lagoon. The traffic was very quiet there, and the lagoon was truly beautiful.
Our luggage was safely transported to our destination.
This tour is highly recommended for anyone traveling here!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Was a very awesome Trip. Ky and Huu were really friendly guides. First we went to the top of the Mountain in danang and then to a very nice waterfall for a swim.

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We had a great day with Johnny (Duyen) and Chan!! For anyone who isn’t as confident about jumping on a motorbike and attempting the Hai Van Pass, this is the perfect trip for you. The trip is very well paced and Duyen and Chan are both excellent drivers. The scenery is stunning, lunch is fantastic and the swim at the waterfall is the perfect refreshing afternoon dip. What a great way to get from Hoi An to Hue!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We had the pleasure of being guided by John over the Hai Van Pass during our recent trip to Vietnam, and we cannot recommend him enough. John's emotional investment in his work is evident from the moment you meet him.

He took the time to get to know each of us personally, asking about our interests and preferences to ensure that our experience on the Hai Van Pass was tailored to our needs. John's attention to detail and genuine care for his clients made us feel like we were traveling with a close friend rather than a tour guide.

Furthermore, John's ability to anticipate our needs and concerns was truly remarkable. He went above and beyond to ensure that we were comfortable and safe throughout our journey, and he even went out of his way to help us with some unexpected challenges we encountered.

Overall, we cannot thank John enough for his exceptional guidance and care during our trip to the Hai Van Pass. He truly embodies the spirit of hospitality and service, and we would recommend him without hesitation to anyone looking for an unforgettable experience in Vietnam."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,The tour was awesome. I was picked up at 8am. First we drove through the country side and to a small market as we were waiting for two others. My driver Trang was super nice. He made sure that I felt comfortable and showed me a lot. I highly recommend a tour with the Amazing Easyriders. It was definitely a highlight of my Vietnam trip.
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Great company! They picked us up from the train station in Hue and brought us to Hoi An with their motorbikes. Beautiful trip, with nice stops. Definitely recommended."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Huu was an amazing rider and felt safe and comfortable. He made sure I was safe and ready. Took me to some awesome views. Unfortunately the weather was cloudy but still enjoyable. I highly recommend him.

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Excellent day tour from Hue to Hoi An, Via the waterfall, high van pass. Amazing drivers and very nice stopping places along the way."

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Had such a lovely experience doing the Hai Van Pass with brother John & Kyle. Brother John was super helpful, friendly & told us lots of information along the way. The waterfalls were amazing & the lunch included delicious. Book with these if you want a guaranteed good experience that you won’t forget!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Best experience ever! Brother John was the best. Couldn’t have asked for a better tour guide. Can’t recommend enough!!!
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"I enjoyed the tour.
The guide speaks a little English and is friendly."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"As a couple in our late 50’s with no experience of motorbikes we were quite nervous about the 90mile trip from Hue to Hoi an. We were picked up on time at 8am from our hotel in Hue, our large holdalls that weighed about 22Kg were sent separately to our chosen hotel in Hoi an and once we’d met up with the two others in our party we were off. We did not take the highway but instead weaved through the labyrinth of paddyfields, stopping every 30mins or so for tea, coffee, water or just an photo opportunity. Duyen and his team were thoughtful and considerate of our needs.
We stopped at waterfalls to swim and lunch just before the Hai Van pass. The pass itself was not as busy as we were expecting with few lorries, mainly bikes and cars so in no way did we feel in any danger on the tight corners. We rode through Da Nang and onto our destination via the Marble mountains. We arrived around 6pm which seems long but we had so many stops it did not seem as though we had been riding all day.
I cannot recommend this tour highly enough. Our pre trip nerves were totally unfounded"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Great experience and is a must for anyone doing the Hai long pass. Peace and love BP out
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Great experience! The tour brought us to a lot of cool places, and the tour guide was awesome! Good value for money"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Was an amazing ride with nice stops along the way! The waterfall was so refreshing before a nice lunch 😊

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"It was a great tour, the guide was great and made sure we were all safe. Good fun"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Very nice recommendet! John was very friendly and helpful :)
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Highly recommended
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"You won’t be disappointed, very very nice drivers, they will take very good care of you!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Had a great trip with amazing easy riders, made our transfer from Hue to Hoi An very memorable and a true highlight of our trip to Vietnam! The drivers were all very kind and funny, we felt completely safe despite not having ridden on motorbikes before. We made lots of stops along the way for photos and experiences, and for the price it included SO MANY things, the lunch was huge and filling, and the marble mountain tour was very interesting! Would highly recommend to anyone (P.S our luggage was safely transported to hoi an for us also!)"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,We were a group of five and did the Hai van pass tour from Hoi An to Hue. We got one jeep and two easy rider motorbikes. This way everyone could change between sitting in the jeep or on the bikes. We felt very safe with our drivers the whole trip. They stopped at great viewpoints and the time we spent at each stop was enough. The lunch was also great. Really recommend doing this tour with Amazing easy riders!
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"A very nice biker tour. I ride a motorcycle myself and I have to say that I felt very comfortable and safe as a passenger. The drivers arrived at the hotel on time and packed our luggage securely with protective film, which I thought was very nice. We were able to take beautiful photos during the photo stop. We also had good stops for coffee and lunch at the waterfall. I really enjoyed the Vietnamese food. The drivers were always polite and helpful. I'm glad I wasn't driving myself, so I could relax and enjoy the beautiful route from the back.

I would like to thank my driver Duyen again; he was wonderful.

Thank you, thank you. I will never forget this motorcycle trip."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,One of the most wonderful experiences I had in Vietnam. The guys rode very safely and comfortable and showed us very beautiful spots that we would have missed otherwise. Particularly loved the stops in the area of rural Huê where we could experience traditional fishing and agriculture. Definitely an experience not to miss and very recommend.
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"I really can recommend Amazing Easy Riders. Everything was a highlight for me! The drivers were not only very experienced and professional but also incredibly fun! We had a very foggy and rainy day that we did it, but it was absolutely incredible still! The views had ominous feelings and it felt like driving through a movie scene. I never once felt unsafe, eventhough we were driving on a slippery road. They always made sure we felt comfortable and safe with them and were sooo fun to be around with! I would do it again in a heartbeat and can only recommend it to anyone looking for an adventurous way to go from Hue to Hoi An or the other way around, in ANY weather condition. At the end of the day we were a small family and I am so grateful I got to experience this! Thank you so muchhhh to our drivers and wspecially Duyen for being so loving!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"I was doing the Hai Van Pass from Hoi An - excellent communication before the trip.

I had never been on a motorbike before and felt such at ease.

Best tour to date on my holiday, chatted with the locals, great pics, amazing scenery and the food on route 👌.

I was asking alot of random questions along the way and was good to get the local chat, and not a typical sales/tourist pitch.

Would highly recommend!

Thank you for a great day!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"This experience has simply been the most incredible of our time whilst travelling the entirety of south east Asia!

John our guide was amazing, very informative, kind, funny and knows an unbelievable magic trick, so definitely bring some cards!

The route which you will embark on goes through some stunning country roads, the scenery is picture perfect and the fishing village is very interesting with so many facts to learn.

We then headed off to a remote waterfall which was so nice as it was beautiful with no tourists around, after that we headed off to get some lunch which was the nicest lunch we have had in Vietnam, so fresh and was delicious!

After we gorged our delicious lunch we headed to the Hai Van Pass and words cannot describe the beauty of the views which you will encounter, it didn’t matter that the weather wasn’t the best because everything still looked like it was taken from a movie set. Once we reached the peak it was time to head down and have the most scenic drive along the coast to our final destination at the hotel.

This is a must do experience and the only way this should be done is through this company!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We had the BEST day. It was one of my favourite days so far on our South East Asia trip, even though the weather wasn’t on our side! John went above and beyond to make us feel safe. He was extremely friendly and funny, he made the day as good as it was! I think John might be one of the kindest people we’ve met so far.
The price was extremely good for what we did in the day - we visited a waterfall, had an amazing local lunch, had a coffee, and of course went across the Hai Van Pass. He stopped at all the good view points and made sure we got our photos too. Couldn’t recommend this company enough! A day I’ll never forget!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Amazing day.
Genuinely one of the best days of our travels so far!
John was so friendly and helped us the entire way! Stopped off for coffees, food etc. (Food was local and so so good! We are very careful with foods but believe me it was unreal)

Many view points which were breath taking!
The value for money was so good as he ended up being so much cheaper that anyone else.

John takes a scenic route and goes on the less busy roads which is great for someone like me with less experience on a bike!
You also get to see the rural side of Hue which is really nice.

10/10 service
10/10 day
10/10 experience

100% recommend"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Very good bike and service! We rented a bike with Flower in Hoi an and our bag was brought to Hue safe and sound! The bike worked perfect and John (owner of the company) is a very nice and helpful! We gave the bike back and picked up our bags (while John gave us a beer)! He even offered us to bring us to the city centre after. Perfect service and very nice people!
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Had such an amazing day with Ky and Hoang! My friend and I went from Hue to Hoi An on a private tour via Hai Van Pass. We stopped in Da Nang as well. They picked us up at our hotel in Hue and dropped us off at our hotel in Hoi An. They knew all the great photo spots and were so helpful in taking our photos. We asked to stop for ice cream which isn’t part of the tour, but they were happy to. Definitely recommend. 👍🏼"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Duyen is an incredible host and a great character. He was super friendly and very helpful. He even helped us out of a few pickles, which we really appreciated. Thank you Duyen! I would absolutely recommend his company to any travellers."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Amazing!!
John was such a lovely man, along with his brother Huy. They made sure I had the bike I wanted and called to give advice throughout the ride"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"I booked the two day tour of Huế to Hội an, and you should too. John is a cheerful, knowledgeable, and honest guide who went out of his way to ensure we felt safe and had a great time."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"A wonderful tour with John! We (our group consisted of just two people) got to experience Vietnam off the beaten track, drank tea with a family, and had a blast! The tour with Amazing Easy Riders is definitely highly recommended!"

This ancient town is located in the Thanh Ha - Bao Vinh port chain, one of the two largest ancient trading ports in Dang Trong in the 17th - 19th centuries, along with Hoi An port (Quang Nam). In 1636, after moving the Lord's palace from Phuc An to Kim Long, Lord Nguyen Phuc Lan chose the Sinh intersection overlooking Thuan An border gate to open Thanh Ha port. Formed on the land of two villages Minh Huong and Dia Linh due to the migration and settlement of Chinese people, Thanh Ha port quickly became a bustling trading port, bustling with boats on the wharf and under the boat. Merchant ships from China, Japan, India and some European countries often docked at the port to buy and sell goods."

Learning this history, just stepping inside created a special atmosphere.

The vast 5,000-square-meter grounds are filled with tropical fruits like jackfruit, and just walking around soothes the soul. The highlight of the estate is the ""pillar house"" (nhà rường), built in the traditional Hue style. It features detached buildings on both sides of the main building, meticulously carved in detail, and its traditional interior has been preserved. I found myself lost in time, gazing at the house, imagining what life was like for the princesses of the time.

While the garden itself is free to visit, entering the house costs 20,000 VND. If you're interested in Hue culture and architecture, I highly recommend taking a tour inside."

ChIJ-Ts5NrymQTERVSAkw3IwbjU,"This garden house began to appear in the late 19th century when the 18th princess of King Duc Duc built the house. After that, the house was passed through the hands of many noble people, most notably Mrs. Dao Thi Xuan Yen, wife of the Governor Nguyen Dinh Chi, who preserved this heritage until 1997. Currently, her descendants continue to preserve it, turning An Hien into a living symbol of the aristocratic lifestyle of the Nguyen Dynasty, through many events of war and revolution. The architecture of the house consists of three main rooms and two wings with pillars made from rare jackfruit wood. The roof is tiled in layers, the climax is decorated with lotus flowers symbolizing purity. Passing through the ancient brick archway hidden under the shade of the trees is a ""Tho"" shaped screen that helps block evil spirits according to feng shui, then the brick-paved path leads straight to the central worship space, where there is a gilded red-lacquered horizontal lacquered board with the four words ""Van Vo Trung Hieu"", given by King Bao Dai in 1937. Around the garden, fruit trees bloom all year round including jackfruit, guava, durian, dragon fruit, mixed with roses, jasmine, and brilliant camellias. Everything blends together to create a harmonious natural picture. Sitting and sipping a cup of delicious jasmine tea feels so relaxing. The tour guide is cute, enthusiastic, easy to understand, and has a captivating voice."

Ok, a bit annoying but still acceptable... until... the security guard asked me to charge 200,000 VND because I was holding a digital camera with the reason of taking professional photos, not a phone.

I asked him again, what is the difference between a professional camera and a phone, but he couldn't answer.
The price list also didn't clearly distinguish the price for taking photos on a phone or the price for taking professional photos. There was only the price for a video camera.
When he couldn't answer, he turned to ask a tour guide (wearing ao dai) and then mumbled and agreed to give me a price of 50,000 VND for taking photos.
I confirmed that he was trying to get more money from out-of-town tourists like me. At the same time, there were foreign tourists also holding cameras but he didn't mention anything.
The cost is expensive.

The garden house charges 30k/person to visit. For those who like taking photos, this is also a place to visit and feel the beauty of old Hue.
However, the tour guide in the garden house has not introduced to the guests the beautiful and precious things of the garden house, the guests have to experience it themselves."

ChIJ-Ts5NrymQTERVSAkw3IwbjU,"Located on the north bank of the Perfume River, on the way to Thien Mu Pagoda, An Hien Garden House has existed for more than a century, still preserving almost intact the beauty of the landscape and ancient Hue garden house architecture, bearing the quintessence of the aristocracy and traditional folk colors. 
The garden house's campus is almost square, 7000 m2 wide, planned and built according to traditional architectural principles. 
The path from the gate to the house is more than 30m long and covered with two rows of white apricot trees; 
In front of the house is a very large shallow pond and a fairly large brick screen; 
In the middle of the garden is a three-room, two-wing house with exemplary structure and carvings. Inside the house are mahogany beds, tea cabinets, horizontal lacquered boards, parallel sentences, and furniture arranged in a harmonious and reasonable manner, giving the house a distinct spirit. 
An Hien Garden House owns many valuable relics of the Nguyen Dynasty's royal court. that is the horizontal plaque “literary and martial loyalty and filial piety” given by King Bao Dai in 1937, along with many poems by King Thanh Thai hung in the reception area.
In the garden, there are many types of high-class perennial plants taken from three regions and hundreds of precious flowers, taking turns blooming and bearing fruit in all four seasons.
An Hien garden house is a typical representative of Hue garden house, showing the harmony between human life and plants, between spiritual and material life, complementing each other to create balance in life."

ChIJ-Ts5NrymQTERVSAkw3IwbjU,"With nearly 7k m2 of land, there are 2 old jackfruit wood houses and a brick house located next to each other. The house was raised higher than the original to prevent termites from eating the pillars, now it is raised with stone pillars. The house is roofed with 5 layers of tiles, the floor has been replaced with bricks now. In front of the house is a small pond with water lilies, there are brick paths in the garden. In total, there are about 300 trees from the North, South and Central regions. Some trees are probably 100 years old. The garden house is located right on the bank of the Huong River, formerly the residence of the princess, after a period of buying and selling, the garden house is now owned by a Hanoian who is the owner of Silkpath Hotel. There is a security guard outside watching the car without a ticket, the entrance fee is 50k. If you want to enter the house and listen to the introduction and drink tea and eat cake, you will probably have to pay extra. If you just want to look at the house, I think you should only charge 10k for students and 20k for tourists."

ChIJ-Ts5NrymQTERVSAkw3IwbjU,A rare historical relic still preserved in Hue. Although it is a bit disappointing in terms of scale and architecture compared to the imagination of a princess's palace. But this is still a historical relic worth studying for future generations to learn about the life of the ancient royal class.
ChIJ-Ts5NrymQTERVSAkw3IwbjU,"Experience visiting the garden and the architecture of the ancient aristocratic houses. Although I went in the early afternoon, it was very cool and pleasant to step into the house. The spacious yard with the highlight of the tree arch at the entrance is very graceful, bearing the style of a princess's house. The ticket price is 50k/person to experience: tour guide's explanation, enjoy tea and visit and take photos. Those who go alone should go in the morning, because according to me, the tour guide said that in the morning it will be more crowded, no need to wait and there will be music."
ChIJ-Ts5NrymQTERVSAkw3IwbjU,
ChIJ-Ts5NrymQTERVSAkw3IwbjU,"I visited the garden on a rainy day at 1:30 p.m., the entrance fee was only 50k, going at this time was quite deserted so you could enjoy the serenity and delicate beauty of the garden

When you enter, you will be invited to enjoy lotus tea and will be explained about the history as well as interesting stories related to the culture and feng shui of the garden

I encourage you to come here on a day with a little bit of rain, because at that time, from the entrance to the scenery of the garden, everything exudes a very unique beauty, fresh, rustic, close and ancient."

ChIJ-Ts5NrymQTERVSAkw3IwbjU,"When arriving in Hue, besides famous landmarks such as Hue Citadel, Thien Mu Pagoda or Truong Tien Bridge, you cannot miss another wonderful destination: An Hien Garden House. This place is not only an ancient garden with a cool green space, but also carries within it the historical and cultural beauty of a glorious period. The experience of visiting An Hien Garden House will definitely bring you unforgettable emotions.

From the moment I stepped into the garden, I felt a completely different atmosphere compared to the hustle and bustle of modern life. The large ancient trees with lush foliage seemed to embrace the space, creating a gentle shade. The chirping of birds and the cool breeze blowing through made me feel like I was lost in a peaceful, quiet world, completely separate from the surrounding noise."
ChIJ-Ts5NrymQTERVSAkw3IwbjU,"This is a grand rip off! 50.000 cash (no ticket) charged for 1 min walk. There us nothing to see or do. When I asked he lady at the front to tell me about the history of the placeshe surprisingly replied ""for tourists only""..dont even bother.."
ChIJ-Ts5NrymQTERVSAkw3IwbjU,"The garden house is very green (-.-), peaceful, the gardener and the tour guide here are super cute.

ChIJ-Ts5NrymQTERVSAkw3IwbjU,"Entrance fee is 50k/person
You can stay as long as you want, there is a room inside to drink tea, the Princess's house, so the space is ancient, very nice. The tree fair is extremely beautiful."
ChIJ-Ts5NrymQTERVSAkw3IwbjU,"The singing is very good, gentle, cute, and smiling, but the total price is only 50k/person, which is very cheap.

No one should go on the dragon boat, it's terrible, the boat is broken, the singing is bad, the playing is bad, and the rowing is expensive."
ChIJ-Ts5NrymQTERVSAkw3IwbjU,"The former princess's house was later bought by officials and kept clean. The garden is very beautiful and retains the traditional features of the ancient house. The house is spacious and clean, the staff is enthusiastic and attentive."

ChIJ588O0yKhQTERxVXcMCqSUL4,"Hue City, famous for its quiet and ancient features, has a completely different color in the Western Quarter - where the hustle and bustle, fun and modernity in tourism converge. Located on routes such as Chu Van An, Pham Ngu Lao, Vo Thi Sau, the Western Quarter becomes an attractive destination for both international tourists and domestic youth. 
At night, the quarter lights up with sparkling lights from bars, pubs, restaurants, and international-style cafes. Lively music resounds, mixed with bustling laughter, creating a lively atmosphere. Activities such as street music performances, night markets, street food, etc. take place regularly, bringing diverse experiences to visitors. 
The flexibility in organizing events and promoting tourism associated with local culture is also a strength of Hue. Despite its modernity, the Western Quarter still retains the ""Hue quality"" through friendly, gentle service style, and dishes rich in the flavors of the ancient capital. 
The Western Quarter is a testament to the dynamic transformation in Hue's tourism approach – both youthful and retaining the old spirit."
ChIJ588O0yKhQTERxVXcMCqSUL4,"I went on Saturday, it was very crowded. Instead of choosing a modern crowded restaurant, I chose a classic and long-standing restaurant. If you come to Hue, please come and experience it. Hue is not as sad as you think. Still bustling and vibrant."

ChIJ588O0yKhQTERxVXcMCqSUL4,"Very disappointing! Sure, the street is the best the city has to offer in the evenings, but unfortunately, like the rest of the city, it's completely dirty and crowded! There are plenty of bars where it's apparently customary to simply throw your empty beer cans under the table. The service staff don't even smile. Be careful, you'll constantly be approached asking if you want to change money or if you want to do drugs! This kind of behavior was so bad that we preferred to have a drink in the hotel bar."
ChIJ588O0yKhQTERxVXcMCqSUL4,It's has changed a lot since the 60 where my Mom and her siblings grew up.

The immersive technology brought Vietnam's rich cultural and historical heritage to life in a way that was both engaging and educational. The visuals were stunning, the storytelling was well-paced, and the user-friendly interface made it accessible to all.

What stood out most was the professionalism and enthusiasm of the staff—they were knowledgeable, welcoming, and clearly passionate about sharing this innovative experience. Whether you're a history enthusiast, tech lover, or just curious about Vietnam’s past in a new light, I highly recommend this tour. It's a unique blend of tradition and technology that shouldn’t be missed.

Thank you, IV Com Center, for a memorable and inspiring experience!

It's Vietnamese style and has a variety of frames, and since there's an AI background here, I was able to take pictures as if I was on another tourist course I'd taken right away, so I took several pictures haha.
Above all, the picture quality is good! For your information, the staff are friendly and when I visited, there was even a staff member who spoke Korean!"

ChIJHWPLozqhQTER9umDDWNoOoU,Wonderful area at night —relaxing lifestyle beside the river… can take long leisurely walks along the river or have a picnic with family along here as well while enjoying the changing colours of the bridge
ChIJHWPLozqhQTER9umDDWNoOoU,The Thuong Bac Palace is located on the north bank of the Perfume River and is a relic belonging to the Hue Monuments Complex. It was built in 1875 during the reign of King Tu Duc.
ChIJHWPLozqhQTER9umDDWNoOoU,
ChIJHWPLozqhQTER9umDDWNoOoU,"Originally, in 1875 under the reign of King Tu Duc, a building called Thuong Bac Institute (Tòa Thương Bạc) was constructed near the current park's location to welcome imperial envoys. In front of it, a pavilion near the riverbank was built to receive merchants; this was the Thuong Bac Pavilion (Đình Thương Bạc).
In 1921, King Khai Dinh rebuilt the pavilion into an octagonal structure using new materials. Over time, the Thuong Bac Institute was repurposed and no longer exists. However, the Thuong Bac Pavilion remained and the surrounding area eventually developed into the Thuong Bac Park we see today, a scenic spot by the Perfume River."
ChIJHWPLozqhQTER9umDDWNoOoU,"The central area specializes in organizing culinary events of Hue Citadel, focusing on fairs and is worth being an interesting destination when exploring Hue for tourists and locals."
ChIJHWPLozqhQTER9umDDWNoOoU,
ChIJHWPLozqhQTER9umDDWNoOoU,Amazing park with great electric ride ons for kids. There every night!

ChIJHWPLozqhQTER9umDDWNoOoU,
ChIJHWPLozqhQTER9umDDWNoOoU,Great place for family to hangout in the event
ChIJHWPLozqhQTER9umDDWNoOoU,
ChIJHWPLozqhQTER9umDDWNoOoU,"In 1875, King Tu Duc did not want to welcome foreign envoys in the capital, so he built a silver trading post outside the upper gate. On the opposite side, he built a communal house near the river bank to receive merchants.
After the fall of the capital (July 5, 1885), the trading house was abandoned and collapsed.
In 1936, the king ordered the rebuilding of the silver hospital (silver trading house) on the left bank of the Huong River, about 100m from the old location to remember that relic.
The silver communal house was built in the old style with new materials, including two roof floors, built on a 1.30m high square foundation. The lower floor plan is octagonal, the upper floor is reduced to a square, with the word ""silver trade"" inlaid in blue porcelain on all four sides. The pillars are made of concrete and the roof is covered with lapis lazuli tiles. The floor is paved with square tiles, surrounded by low flower walls, and there are steps on all four sides.
On the top of the roof are two dragons flanking the sun, and the roof corners are stylized with decorations. In front of the communal house is a large yard, facing the street are 4 square pillars, on top of which is a lotus flower, on each pillar is a parallel sentence made of porcelain, recording the rich beauty of the capital.
Thuong Bac Park starts from Phu Xuan Bridge to Trang Tien Bridge, along the banks of the Huong River and Tran Hung Dao Street, and is also where Hue City holds the spring flower festival every year."

A bustling entertainment place for Hue people. 

This is a public park so there is no entrance fee, I don't know about the parking lot, I see people parking their cars and looking after them themselves, so there is no problem. 
There is a public toilet but no one is on duty so it is not very clean."

ChIJq3G3BzuhQTERfnUyGO323K8,"Nguyễn Đình Chiểu Walking Street in Huế is a hidden gem that offers a delightful mix of local charm, culture, and relaxation right in the heart of the city. I spent an evening here during my recent trip to Huế and was absolutely enchanted by its peaceful ambiance and riverside beauty.

Stretching along the Perfume River, this walking street is smaller and more intimate than some of the more commercial pedestrian streets in Vietnam, but that’s exactly what makes it special. It’s clean, well-maintained, and has a uniquely calm and romantic atmosphere — especially around sunset, when the sky turns golden and reflects off the water.

What I appreciated most was the blend of local life and gentle tourism. You’ll find local families taking walks, street performers playing traditional Vietnamese instruments, and small stalls selling art, souvenirs, and light snacks. There are also several charming cafés and teahouses where you can sit and enjoy the view while sipping a cold drink or Vietnamese coffee.

The street is beautifully lit in the evening, with colorful lanterns and tasteful lighting that enhances the cozy and poetic feel. It’s the perfect place to take a leisurely stroll, unwind after a day of sightseeing, or just people-watch and feel the rhythm of Huế.

If you’re visiting Huế, don’t miss this spot. Nguyễn Đình Chiểu Walking Street is the kind of place that doesn’t try too hard — it simply lets Huế’s gentle soul speak for itself. Five stars without a doubt."

Located along the southern bank of the Perfume River, it stretches from Phu Xuan Bridge to Truong Tien Bridge and opens daily from late afternoon into the evening. As the sun sets, the area comes alive with street vendors selling snacks, drinks, and handcrafted souvenirs. The LED-lit bridges and river breeze create a peaceful backdrop for strolling, people-watching, or catching impromptu street performances.

The street is compact but full of character—ideal for a short walk or a casual night out. It’s pedestrian-only, making it safe and quiet compared to busier city zones. Locals gather for music, games, and evening hangouts, while visitors enjoy the mix of food stalls, art displays, and photo spots. It’s not a major shopping hub, but it’s a great place to soak in Hue’s laid-back nightlife and riverside charm."

Everyone should come here at least once in their life to experience and love Vietnamese history. I am also very proud because my maternal family is a descendant of Pham Phu, who was a mandarin of the Nguyen Dynasty. I hope there will be many more opportunities to visit Hue to visit Hue Royal Palace. Everyone should buy an entrance ticket to visit and contribute to the cost of restoring the citadel."
ChIJ7ZePIy6hQTERHP94LYVfeAI,"The traditional design space in harmony with the garden landscape helps create a peaceful space for the mind when visiting the museum.
The arrangement of antiques is also good and I heard that depending on the period, the exhibition has different themes.
The antiques are diverse and sophisticated.
Visitors can buy some souvenirs at the end of the journey. I have supported the museum with a bronze seal in the shape of a Nghe, which is very cool."

ChIJ7ZePIy6hQTERHP94LYVfeAI,"Highly recommend everyone to come here to see the super sophisticated royal antiques.

This is a small museum, which can be visited within 1-2 hours, and integrates some other exhibitions on the premises such as the exhibition about the life of King Ham Nghi and the paintings he drew, the Champa Museum. If you go to the Hue Citadel, you can stop by.

I arrived at 11-12 am and it was very quiet, just me and a few foreign guests. The ticket purchase procedure was quick and easy, no need to wait, no need to book tickets in advance.

The security team and staff were quite small, so everyone was self-sufficient. In the main museum, there will be uncles and aunts sitting at the door, but in the small exhibitions, there were no people. My friend and I plugged in the TV and interacted with the device to see the slides in the exhibition about King Ham Nghi hicc :)))

The campus is beautiful, with lots of trees and quiet.

The beautiful treasures, carefully preserved and annotated, are displayed in a completely wooden space, creating a very harmonious feeling.

Note: Do not bring drinks into the museum because water can fall and affect the wooden floor. You should go outside if you want to eat or drink."

ChIJ7ZePIy6hQTERHP94LYVfeAI,"The museum is dedicated to preserving and showcasing artifacts from the Nguyen Dynasty (1802-1945), Vietnam's last feudal dynasty.

ChIJ7ZePIy6hQTERHP94LYVfeAI,"It looks a bit like the Taiwan Palace Museum but on a smaller scale
The artifacts are only 2-3 centuries old, none of them have a 1000-year content and the quantity is also small

ChIJ7ZePIy6hQTERHP94LYVfeAI,It's a small but interesting museum exhibition. The interior of the building is very beautiful. Price 50.000 dong
ChIJ7ZePIy6hQTERHP94LYVfeAI,"The Royal Museum of Antiquities of Hue is said to be the oldest museum in Hue. Originally built by Emperor Khai Dinh in 1923, the building itself was moved from another palace in 1845, and I was immediately impressed by its rich history. It's also fascinating to learn that Emperor Khai Dinh, a great lover of art, sought to understand his country's culture through art.

Originally named after him, the museum's name changed over the years to its current name.

Stepping inside, I was awed by the more than 8,000 beautiful royal artifacts left behind by Vietnam's last dynasty. From the resplendent throne and imperial costumes to tableware, furniture, and even mother-of-pearl flooring, the museum is filled with beautifully preserved, priceless pieces. Reading the explanation that each piece is unique, crafted by artisans specializing in royal art, I marveled at the high level of skill and meticulous work of the artisans of the time.

This museum is included in the admission ticket for the Royal Palace (150,000 VND) and is not sold separately. It is only a 7-minute walk from the East Gate of the Royal Palace, so it is recommended to visit it together with sightseeing at the Royal Palace."

ChIJ7ZePIy6hQTERHP94LYVfeAI,"The outside space has royal architecture,
The parking fee inside is 5k, the entrance fee is 50k.
When visiting, there are many antiques from the Nguyen Dynasty, but I was quite surprised because there were very few exhibits and nothing outstanding to experience, it took about 20 minutes to visit everything."
ChIJ7ZePIy6hQTERHP94LYVfeAI,

This is a practical activity that needs to be maintained regularly to form sustainable design thinking and cultural depth for students of architecture."

The building itself is magnificent, and the collections incredible.
Objects such as tableware, vases (including a bronze one made in France and presented to a high-ranking dignitary in Hue), stone bonsai trees, and decorative items are a testament to the expertise of Vietnamese artisans.
The clothing of the king's mother particularly impressed me. The delicate details and impeccable state of preservation are truly impressive.
Note a detail on the wall opposite the entrance to the main building, halfway up on the left and right, a medium-sized mother-of-pearl detail, perhaps about thirty centimeters. It is a palindrome that can be read in about sixty different ways."
ChIJ7ZePIy6hQTERHP94LYVfeAI,
ChIJ7ZePIy6hQTERHP94LYVfeAI,"Hue Royal Antiquities Museum is a place worth visiting in Hue. It would be a mistake if you visit Hue Imperial City without visiting the Hue Royal Antiquities Museum.

ChIJe2d00l2hQTERcpaIXwDL7i4,"Nice little escape from the city. I was the only one on the mountain and had a good time.

Follow the street that someone else in the review section mentioned with a screenshot of maps. It’s a 15 min steep climb. I have done it in flip flops, which doable but I would wear normal shoes next time.

When you are on top, you can just follow the track and descend on the other site of the mountain. You will end up in a cemetery and will have to find your way to a small road just in front of the cemetery. Then turn right and right again, walk 100m and on your left side you will find a huge monument of à former Vietnamese general, quite impressive.

Next to the monument you will find stairs that go up a little hill, follow the stairs, go down again on the other side and then you will find the grave of ho chi minhs mother"

ChIJe2d00l2hQTERcpaIXwDL7i4,"The perfect mountain for beginners to climb. It took me about 10 minutes to climb all the way from the foot of the mountain to the top. Because there is a pre-existing path, you can just climb up, but the road is quite steep and dangerous. Remember to wear shoes with good adhesion to avoid falling due to slipping. Climbing up is easy, but going down is quite overwhelming for those who are not used to it. Since the reign of King Gia Long, this mountain was chosen as a criminal record, a natural screen shielding the Hue citadel, meaning to protect the prosperity of the dynasty. More specifically, King Gia Long ordered each mandarin to plant a pine tree on the mountain, creating a vast green pine forest that is still a symbol of Ngu Binh today. Standing on the top, you can see the beautiful panorama of Hue below"
ChIJe2d00l2hQTERcpaIXwDL7i4,A bit surprised because the mountain is small and surrounded by many graves.

ChIJe2d00l2hQTERcpaIXwDL7i4,"The pictures show a place that is next to the hill, not on the hill, follow the road around the hill to find the place with the status.

Then you have to climb to the top (not too high, about 30 minutes to reach the top) Suitable for picnics or weekend outings"
ChIJe2d00l2hQTERcpaIXwDL7i4,Very special
ChIJe2d00l2hQTERcpaIXwDL7i4,"Along with the Perfume River, Ngu Binh Mountain is a wonderful symbol of Hue. Therefore, Ngu Binh is gradually becoming an ideal destination for tourists who love nature and want to enjoy the fresh air. Ngu Binh Mountain is located about 3km from the south bank of the Perfume River, in the former location of Tu Tay Hamlet, An Cuu Village; then Thuy An Commune, Hue City; now An Cuu Ward of the city. Although this mountain is only 104m high, because it rises suddenly in the middle of flat land, in a special position, since the 17th century, it has been in the sights and caught the eye of Hue urban planners and builders. Indeed, in its history and geography books, the National History Institute of the Nguyen Dynasty clearly recorded that in 1687, when Lord Nguyen Phuc Thai moved the capital from Kim Long to Phu Xuan Village, the architects at that time used this special mountain as a screen, a feng shui element in ancient architecture. At that time, it was called Hon Mo or Bang Son. Bang is a very large bird, like an eagle for example. The reason for the name Bang Son is because the mountain looks like an eagle spreading its wings to fly. This is a natural mountain, but from the north, it looks balanced, the two wings on the east and west sides are symmetrical to each other evenly as if they were built and shaped by human hands. Moreover, the two slopes on both sides of the mountain slightly protrude forward, looking like two arms spreading forward to welcome someone. The beauty of Ngu mountain is not in the feng shui aspect of protecting Hue citadel, the beauty of Ngu mountain is that it is close to the people of Hue, it becomes a platform, a towering building and going up there on artificial steps, people can stretch their eyes to admire the gentle beauty of Hue citadel, listen to the echoes from far below, and feel like they are in some other world, otherworldly."

Founded by Zen Master Minh Hoang Tu Dung in the late 17th century with the original name An Ton, the pagoda was renamed Tu Dam by King Thieu Tri in 1841, meaning ""good clouds"", symbolizing purity and compassion. With more than 300 years of history, this place is not only a Buddhist center but also a valuable cultural heritage of Vietnam. The architecture of Tu Dam Pagoda delicately blends classical and modern features. The tiled gate with sturdy stone steps opens the way to the airy campus, where there is an ancient Bodhi tree, grafted from the Bodhi tree in India in 1936, providing peaceful shade. Here is the 27m high An Ton Stupa with 7 floors, it is said that inside each floor is a bronze Buddha statue, creating a solemn and unique beauty. The main hall was rebuilt in 2006 in the style of the Hue royal palace, the surrounding space is filled with the scent of incense, very pleasant, inside is a statue of Buddha Shakyamuni and two statues of Bodhisattva Manjushri and Samantabhadra. Behind the main hall is the Ancestor's house, where the 28th Zen master Bodhidharma, the Zen master Minh Hoang Tu Dung and his successors are worshiped, showing respect for Buddhist traditions. Next to it is a souvenir room like a small museum, displaying historical relics, helping people understand more about the development of the pagoda. This is one of the pagodas to visit when coming to Hue because of the long history of Buddhist development, and the value of the historical stories it brings."

ChIJSZ8W806hQTER6MKlPCF2_b4,"Từ Đàm Pagoda in Huế is one of the most peaceful and spiritually significant places I’ve ever visited. Nestled in the heart of the ancient imperial city, this pagoda is not only a place of worship but also a cultural and historical landmark that reflects the deep roots of Vietnamese Buddhism.

What makes Từ Đàm Pagoda especially meaningful to me is the legacy of one of its most revered monks: Venerable Thích Trí Quang. I have long admired him for his intellect, his dedication to Buddhism, and especially his work translating and interpreting many important Buddhist texts into Vietnamese. His influence on Vietnamese Buddhism, both in spiritual and cultural terms, is profound. Though he has passed away, his spirit and teachings are very much alive in this sacred space. It was incredibly moving to walk through the grounds and know that this was a place he once walked, taught, and meditated.

The pagoda itself is beautiful — quiet, clean, and filled with the scent of incense. The architecture is traditional yet timeless, with a large main hall, well-tended gardens, and statues that inspire a deep sense of calm and reverence. The monks and caretakers are kind and respectful, and there is a genuine atmosphere of compassion and wisdom here.

If you are in Huế and seeking a meaningful spiritual experience — or simply want a quiet space to reflect — I highly recommend visiting Từ Đàm Pagoda. For me, it was more than a visit; it was a moment of connection with history, faith, and the legacy of a great teacher."

ChIJSZ8W806hQTER6MKlPCF2_b4,"Tu Dam Pagoda is a famous ancient pagoda in Hue, currently located at 1 Su Lieu Quan Street, Truong An Ward, Thuan Hoa District, Hue City, Vietnam.

History
The pagoda was founded by Zen Master Minh Hoang - Tu Dung[1] around the end of the 17th century, and was later named An Ton Pagoda (印宗寺, or Tong), meaning ""taking the transmission of the mind as the main principle""[2].

In 1702, monk Lieu Quan (later also a high monk) came to the pagoda, asking to study with Zen Master Minh Hoang - Tu Dung[3]

In 1703, Zen Master Minh Hoang - Tu Dung restored the pagoda. Also in this year, Lord Nguyen Phuc Chu granted the pagoda the Sac Tu An Ton Tu plaque. After the Master passed away, according to his will, his student Zen Master Thiet Vinh - Buu Hanh became the abbot of the pagoda.

In 1802, the Tay Son dynasty was overthrown. At that time, due to time and war, An Ton Pagoda was severely damaged like many other pagodas in the region [4]. However, it was not until the 12th year of Gia Long (1813) that Zen Master Dao Trung - Trong Nghia was able to organize the restoration of the pagoda [5]. 

In 1841, King Thieu Tri changed the name of An Ton Pagoda to Tu Dam-慈曇寺 (to avoid the taboo of the king's name Mien Tong) [5], meaning ""the auspicious cloud of Buddhism"" [6]. 

In the 9th year of Thanh Thai (1897), the king ordered the road to Nam Giao altar to be opened. Because this road passed through the grounds of Tu Dam Pagoda, the king ordered the abbot, Zen Master Thanh Hiep - Tuong Van, to move the 5 stupas containing the remains of the ancestors to the grounds of Bao Quoc Pagoda nearby. Perhaps on this occasion, the abbot had the pagoda restored again [7]. 

From the 1920s onwards, the Vietnamese Buddhist revival movement developed in all three regions. During that time, Tu Dam Pagoda was the center of the Central Buddhist Revival Movement[8].

In 1932, the An Nam Buddhist Association (later renamed the Central Vietnamese Buddhist Association) was established in Hue... In 1936, the Lam Te sect agreed to hand over Tu Dam Pagoda to the association as a place of worship and as the association's headquarters.

On December 18, 1938, the Thua Thien Provincial Buddhist Association had Tu Dam Pagoda extensively renovated, and at the same time cast a statue of Buddha Shakyamuni and other Dharma instruments to enshrine in the main hall, which was completed in 1940. Other items such as lecture halls, monks' quarters and some offices of the Provincial Association were also built during that time[9].

In 1943, the Gia Dinh Phat Hoa Pho was established; In 1951, it was renamed the Buddhist Family, and its headquarters was located at Tu Dam Pagoda[10].

In 1951, the Congress to establish the Vietnam Buddhist Sangha took place at the pagoda.

In 1951, the Conference to establish the Vietnam Buddhist Sangha (including 51 delegates from 6 groups of monks and lay people in the three regions) was also held here. At that time, the Association also approved the Most Venerable To Lien to sign on behalf of the Association to join the World Buddhist Association.

In the 1960s, Tu Dam Pagoda was the center of activities to fight against the religious policy under President Ngo Dinh Diem.

Currently, the pagoda has the office of the Hue City Buddhist Executive Committee."

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"This trip was amazing. First I was a little afraid to get on the bike but Duyen helped me and said ‘relax lady’. So i did. Off we went! We swan in waterfalls, eat Fresh chicken and walked the bamboo. Very safe, very nice, very professional and sooooo friendly. Highly recommend it. Everyone should do it.
If you wanna do the hai van pass, just like on Top Gear; do do it with them. The bikes are so comfortabel and so safe."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"One of my favourite experiences in Vietnam. The most lovely driver, who have so much energy. You can go with them to do the hai van pass, see waterfall, have lunch; just overall the best day ever. So good that I have already done it with them twice already!! If you are gonna do the hai van pass do it with them. You will see so many cool things from their comfortable moterbikes."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Incredible experience from start to finish. We felt very safe on the bikes and they had the comfiest seats of any bike tour we've done in Asia. We had an amazing lunch at the waterfall with super fresh food, they even stopped to buy us fresh shrimp from the local market on the way. Our bags were safely delivered to our hostel in Hoi An before we arrived and we were collected from our hostel in Hue on time in the morning. Amazing day, amazing views, amazing drivers, we have already recommended this trip to our friends. Also very easy to book via WhatsApp, we were very last minute and booked the day before our trip!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We did the high van pass to Hoi An and had an amazing time! The guide was really kind and even showed us a magic trick! The bikes were very comfy, much needed after doing the Ha Giang Loop. Would definitely recommend"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Amazing experience! Duyen was great from the beginning and gave me all the information I needed to know before I booked. This tour includes the pass, your own bikes or an easy rider, an amazing fresh seafood lunch at Lan Co Beach, swim in a great waterfall, tour through beautiful local rice fields, villages, farms and temples and a visit to the marble temples. Though the tour doesn’t allow enough time to go to the top off marble mountains, only enough time to access one cave. The pass itself was stunning but the tours through local and tucked away landscapes was just as breathtaking. Duyen was very kind, informative and helpful! The gas isn’t included in price but overall was great value and well worth it. Overall was an awesome adventure and a great insight into the local beauty of Hue!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Had such a great day! Duyen was amazing at taking me and my friend along Hai van pass. I don’t have a bike license but he made me feel at ease and was always there in front checking on us throughout. The seafood restaurant we went to was soooo good as well! Such a good amount of stops along the way like the waterfalls, ducks, sugarcane juice and rice fields!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"The ride was amazing. The drivers are experienced, funny and really kind. It was my first time doing something like this and I couldn't hope for something better. We went to the waterfall to have lunch and it was the perfect break.
We felt really safe (we are 2 girls 22 and 25 years old) and welcomed. Definitely suggest it!!!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Amazing experience with our riders! They picked us up in front of our homestay, they secured our luggage and then we hopped on the motorbikes. Since we are not experienced drivers we let them drive for us. The drivers were super safe and kind, they stopped multiple times to let us take wonderful pictures. The bike was large and comfortable. We also stopped by a waterfall and they offered us a delicious lunch. I could not ask for more!

Ps: I went with a friend of mine and we both felt super safe as female travelers."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"10/10 company to use for the Hai Van Pass!! We got recommended this company from a previous hostel - so glad we did! The company were happy to accommodate all my friends (we were a group of 10) with some using easy riders and others riding solo. The easy riders were very good and we felt safe, and the bikes for those going solo were in really good condition. The team took us to a waterfall and some viewpoints. They also took us to a really nice seafood restaurant by the beach for lunch and also treated us all to a beer at the end. The day was really well organised and was one of the highlights of Vietnam!!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Duyen is the best!! I did a three day, two night trip from Phong Nha to Hoi An, along the Ho Chi Minh Trail and through the Hai Van Pass. Duyen is an amazing driver and as a solo female traveller, I felt safe the entire time. He always took the more scenic route which added to the experience and he had excellent local recommendations for food. My luggage was also delivered to my accomodation on time with no issue. Highly recommend ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We went from hue to hoi an with the motorbikes - our suitcases were pocked up from our hotel in hue and brought directly to our hotel in hoi an, which was amazing! we did a nice trip, started a bit earlier (8am) because we needed to be in hoi an at 14:30. this was good, as we were on the stops before many others - for example swam in the waterfall with just 2 other people and saq the wonderful pass. all in all a great experience and an amazing lunch which was vegetarian for us! :)  drivers are experienced and drive safely, motorbikes are bigger than the normal scooters, so you have something to lean on, which is comfy."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We had the best time with Duyen, he went above and beyond making us feel safe and have a great day being our guide through the Hai Van pass, the bikes provided were great, he showed us the best spots, including the waterfall, beach and best viewpoint stops, we can’t thank him enough, he made the whole experience so enjoyable, I would 100% recommend amazing easy riders as it’s a smaller business, with the nicest owner!!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"The best day I’ve had in a long time!! I tell you book this now, you will not regret it. Stunning views, vibes and magic tricks. What an experience"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"I recommend, did the Hai Van Pass from Hué to Hoi An and we had a wonderful day. Duyen is a super nice guy and make everything for you to have it perfect."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"This was such amazing trip. Had such a good time for Hai van Pass trip Top Gear  in Vietnam. He was very professional and also safe,I highly recommend if you are not feeling so comfortable riding in Vietnam because of the traffic.
The food and tickets also included in the price

Advice:you should book online and not on the street as it may not be an easy rider contacting you. Because when I walked in Hué city some people tried to make me hire them as an easy rider and they were not.
They also said that they was brother to John Duyên and they are not.
I was so happy to do the Easy rider with him,i never forgot the trip, i will tell to my friends that, Thank you so much John Duyen"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"My motorbike tour with Duyen was absolutely incredible. A friend recommended him and he was wonderful. Duyen was kind, supportive and made me feel very safe at all times. He was informative and we stopped many times to have breaks, photos and to show me the sights. I had a lot of fun seeing the Hai Van Pass, the countryside and the beautiful rice fields with Duyen. I highly recommend this trip to everyone 🙂"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"I had an amazing time with Duyen, I was recommended to go with him by a friend who took the tour with him a couple of years ago, and I’m very glad that I did.

I am a solo female traveller, and he made me feel very comfortable and was great company along the way. He told me lots of interesting information at our stops and made sure to remind me to top up my suncream (I’m very pale!). He made sure that I got lots of photos, including with me in them. We had a lovely lunch at a seafood place, the food was really fresh and he picked out some dishes for me that he thought I would like - and they were delicious.

Before I even arrived he was really kind and helpful, sending me advice about Hue and safety tips.

I don’t have much experience on a motorbike but he was a very good and safe driver so I felt totally comfortable and had a lot of fun. The ride was great, I really enjoyed the views and I would really recommend this tour to anyone."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"I am a solo female traveler and couldn’t have asked for better company to do that Hai Van pass with.

I felt safe all while having fun with Duyen as he showed me multiple different spots along the way as well as being a great personal photographer which means a lot when you are by yourself.

Great communication through WhatsApp and even advice before I arrived in Hue about safety in the busy areas, it was greatly appreciated and shows Duyen goes above and beyond for his clients.

Delicious food is included in the tour with Duyen giving you the option of what you would like and then taking you to a great restaurant for that food.

Very safe driving and it is an incredibly convenient way of transporting your bag to your destination in Hoi An in their private van.

It was a great day that I would recommend to any other solo traveller or group. I thoroughly enjoyed myself and hope this review convinces others to have a brilliant day in Vietnam on the Hai Van pass."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Nice little trip form hoi an to hue! Duyen drove my mother and then my sister while I was driving behind. We did some very nice stops and had a very good meel. And of course the driving was very safe:)! Thanks a lot!
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Me and my friends had the most amazing day with Duyen! He really took care of all of us and made sure we were safe and having a good time! Highly recommend!
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We had an amazing day going from Hue to Hoi An! Stopped at Beach, Waterfall und beautiful viewpoints. We felt so safe and our leader Duyen took such good care of us!! Would 100% recommend!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,I had a great experience today with amazing easy riders! Duyen really looked after us and made sure everything went well and we were all safe!
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Had a wonderful day with brothers Duyen and Hu going from Da Nang to Hue. Felt absolutely safe and comfortable with them. They are complete professionals at driving and rest assured they made no blind passes or any other dangerous moves. We were treated to a delicious lunch and plenty of stops to rest and take photos. Plus, many other easy riders after the Hai Van pass just take you straight down the highway, but Duyen and Hue took us down side roads to see the beautiful rice fields and Vietnamese countryside. Absolutely recommend these guys, you will have an amazing time!!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"I had the best just the best day with Duyen and Huu riding from Da Nang to Hue! It was my first trip with an easy rider but I felt so safe and comfortable (even with my giant rucksack strapped to the back of the bike)!

Driving down the Hai Van Pass was so much fun and so beautiful! There were so many great stops along the way - I think my favourites were the marble mountain and waterfall - and Duyen and Huu acted as both driver, tour guide and photographer. We also had the most fabulous lunch.

I could not recommend them though!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Fantastic tour with many highlights (waterfall, lunch on the beach, Hai Van Pass, Monkey Island) and stops along the way!

John is 100% reliable and punctual, and he and his team are very safe drivers. Highly recommended!!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We had an amazing ride from Hue to Hoi an with Duyen, Ky and Rone. They were so friendly and Duyen had lots of knowledge of the local area- even recommended a great tailor in Hoi an.
Was easy to book and reliable, also had our luggage transferred by van with no issues. Definitely recommend. Thank you!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"What a wonderful day trip (Hoi An - Hue) this was. A stunningly beautiful route. My easyrider, Duyen, stopped at several locations so I could fully enjoy it. For example, at the Marple Mountains, waterfalls, and a beautiful beach. My backpack was securely strapped to the back, but I could have chosen to have it transported by car. But that worked out perfectly. Duyen is a lovely, calm man. He also drove calmly and safely. The lunch was delicious and in a truly beautiful location. The last stretch we rode through the rice paddies with the sunset. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
In a word: RECOMMENDED!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We rented motorbikes from these guys and self drove from Hue to Hoi An. It was the best and the craziest time of our Vietnam trip so far! Would recommend to everyone! :)

Motorbikes collection went all smooth and quick and the motorbikes themselves were in great condition."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Great experience, the bike worked a dream and was perfect for navigating the Hai Van Pass from Hue to Hoi An, full tank handled all the driving and sight seeing along the way. John and his family were so welcoming and friendly. Thoroughly recommend!"

Took us on a great route with beautiful scenery and stops along the way while never rushing us to get back on the bikes. Delicious lunch by a beautiful waterfall. Our oldest rider was in her 70s so don’t let your age stop you. Highlight of our trip so far!

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"The tour was great. We didn't follow the main route, so we saw some beautiful scenery and animals. The pass itself offers a beautiful view and is definitely recommended!
We had a wonderful day with Johnny. He's very knowledgeable, and you can tell it's important to him that you see a lot and have a great and safe tour."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Duyen was extremely patient and helpful throughout. We had dinner with him at a place he recommended the night before, and got to taste the local cuisine. He was flexible to our needs, and fun to hang out with."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Ok
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We drove from Hue to Hoi An, 2 adults and 2 kids.Both brothers are the most friendly, big hearted guys with lots of knowledge and jokes!! They make sure all travel goes smoothly and safe, the stops are well worth it! Must Do when you have the chance. We will def do it again! Thanx guys, hope to see you in the near future"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Where do I start… The lovely John was our guide for the Hai Van pass and boy did he deliver! He was able to take us on stunning back roads that we wouldn’t have found ourselves and delivered non-stop vibes. John is an all round legend and would 100% recommend going to him for rentals, tours and beers!!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Beautiful experience! Duyen took me on a journey to discover the real Vietnam through rice paddies, lagoons and enchanting landscapes. Several stops along the way, excellent lunch, safe and careful driving. Highly recommended!"

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,We found this amazing man who has let us enjoy the most amazing trip. He was super helpful and went above and beyond what he was providing for us (including taking me to the eye doctors). This man is so lovely and chooses the best route for the Hi Van Pass with scenic views and amazing stop offs on beaches with no tourists. Would 100% recommend booking with him 🫶
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Brilliant experience, we went to the most magical beach and got shown the most extraordinary views, our easy riders were very safe, but what we really loved was how friendly and kind they all were.

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,We had the best day ever !!! John took us on paths that not many people know about so we got to see rural parts of the Vietnamese countryside and rice fields! The easy riders were all so nice and the bikes were so so comfortable! We went to a lovely waterfall and an empty beach and many lovely viewpoints! Lunch was delicious too 😊😊 best day defo recommend 🔥🔥
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We had an amazing experience with Amazing Easy Riders, riding from Hoi An to Hue.
They picked us up from our accommodation and the trip was great. They took us to lots of photo spots away from the main tourist spots, we drove through amazing rice fields with only us around, the stop off at the waterfall with lunch was amazing.
A really incredible experience with the nicest guides, thank you to Duyen and Thuy. Couldn’t recommend them more!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Such a great experience for the Hai Van Pass. After the pass we were taken through amazing back roads, rice paddies and villages with plenty of stops to take photos. The lunch stop at the waterfall was great too."

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"I had an incredible time doing the Hai Van Pass from Hue to Hoi An with Johnny and Ky! I booked on WhatsApp with Ky, who has great English, and had super quick responses. We started with a lovely drive through rice fields to a waterfall where we swam, jumped & slid in! The highlight of this section of the road was the super cute ducklings!!! After going in the waterfall they provided us with plastic bags for our wet stuff which was very thoughtful. We then had a very good lunch - mountain chicken, morning glory, omelette and rice! We then continued driving and stopped at the beach for a wander and Johnny’s very funny magic card trick!!! The Hai Van Pass itself was beautiful and we stopped at lots of viewpoints for amazing photos!!! We also saw monkeys and stopped at a pagoda with a huge Buddha before continuing through Da Nang to Hoi An. I am so glad I was recommended these amazing guys from friends I met during my travels as it was an amazing day! Special shoutout to my easy rider Johnny who had incredible English and was so funny and chatty!!! I will remember this day for a long time - it definitely stands out as one of my favourite days in over 6 months travelling!!!"

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We had a fantastic day with the amazing Easy Riders! Everything was very smooth and seemed very organized. We never rode for longer than 40 minutes and made plenty of stops for sightseeing and taking pictures. We were only a small group of four, which was very pleasant. The Easy Riders went out of their way to give us a great day. We'll especially remember the lunch! We've never eaten such good seafood. Thank you for the fantastic day; we can definitely recommend the tour without reservation :))"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Really good day on the ha van pass Duyen/John was brilliant easy rider and absolutely made our trip!

Stopped off for multiple nice viewpoints, saw the family farm within the rice fields, played bowls with the locals and then football with some local students.

Was one of the best days in vietnam we have had!"

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Very fun day riding from Hue to Hoi An. Felt very safe with our riders, they took us though back roads rather than the highway out of Hue which was really interesting.

Breathtaking scenery and delicious food!
Don't hesitate 👌"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We had a fantastic experience with three friends and our easy riders, John and Ky.
We felt safe on the motorbikes from the start and visited some beautiful places between Hoi An and Hue.

So don't hesitate!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"A wonderful day of motorcycling between Hue and Hoi An. Perfectly organized. With Duyen and his group, you'll enjoy the Vietnamese countryside in the best possible way, from rice paddies to waterfalls and heavenly beaches, all at a very ""holiday"" pace. In short, we had a truly wonderful day; it's a nice change from taking the bus to reach these two cities!
Thank you so much!!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We had a great day with Duyen and Huu. We were able to visit fishing villages, swim in a waterfall and a heavenly beach, without forgetting the multiple viewpoints. The driving team was very friendly and took great care of us. I highly recommend!"

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We met John at the train station exit to head to our hotel, and that was the start of two excellent days. We took advantage of his advice to visit Hue easily and quickly, and at unbeatable prices. He shared his experiences as a former tour guide in very understandable English.
We shared a meal at his home, prepared by his wife, which was delicious.
And we chose to tour Hue and Hoi An with him by motorbike, which wasn't our first choice.
But what a discovery! The team of drivers is professional and friendly. The route is magnificent, with a magnificent view, a beautiful beach, a temple, explanations all along the way, and a clean waterfall. We always felt safe, confident, and well received thanks to him.
Go for it!"

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"I nearly didnt do a tour but so glad i did! I drove myself but two people i met took the easy rider option and we all had a great time. We were taken on some small roads through the countryside which was lovely and the Hai Van pass itself has incredible views.

We stopped at a waterfall for a refreshing swim, a beach for a seafood lunch, the big lady buddha statue in da nang and a couple of viewpoints for photos.

Kai and John were both great guys and very funny which made the trip even more enjoyable. Would definitely recommend this to anyone thinking about doing the Hai Van pass!"

We highly recommend this tour with Amazing Easy Riders!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,The whole experience was amazing Duyen was very safe and stop to take lots of photo and all keep points. This isn't just transport but a high quality day trip. We even added on a stop at the abandoned water park.

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Best tour of our trip!

My fiancée and I had an incredible day with John. He took us on the back roads from Hoi An to Hue. We made many stops along the way. We viewed the marble cliffs, crossed the impressive Cloud Pass (Hai Van), and went swimming at a waterfall. After swimming, we also had dinner together there. It was fantastic!
We drove the rest of the way to Hue along the edge of the lagoon. The traffic was very quiet there, and the lagoon was truly beautiful.
Our luggage was safely transported to our destination.
This tour is highly recommended for anyone traveling here!"

For anyone who isn’t as confident about jumping on a motorbike and attempting the Hai Van Pass, this is the perfect trip for you. The trip is very well paced and Duyen and Chan are both excellent drivers. The scenery is stunning, lunch is fantastic and the swim at the waterfall is the perfect refreshing afternoon dip. What a great way to get from Hoi An to Hue!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We had the pleasure of being guided by John over the Hai Van Pass during our recent trip to Vietnam, and we cannot recommend him enough. John's emotional investment in his work is evident from the moment you meet him.

He took the time to get to know each of us personally, asking about our interests and preferences to ensure that our experience on the Hai Van Pass was tailored to our needs. John's attention to detail and genuine care for his clients made us feel like we were traveling with a close friend rather than a tour guide.

Furthermore, John's ability to anticipate our needs and concerns was truly remarkable. He went above and beyond to ensure that we were comfortable and safe throughout our journey, and he even went out of his way to help us with some unexpected challenges we encountered.

Overall, we cannot thank John enough for his exceptional guidance and care during our trip to the Hai Van Pass. He truly embodies the spirit of hospitality and service, and we would recommend him without hesitation to anyone looking for an unforgettable experience in Vietnam."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,The tour was awesome. I was picked up at 8am. First we drove through the country side and to a small market as we were waiting for two others. My driver Trang was super nice. He made sure that I felt comfortable and showed me a lot. I highly recommend a tour with the Amazing Easyriders. It was definitely a highlight of my Vietnam trip.
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Great company! They picked us up from the train station in Hue and brought us to Hoi An with their motorbikes. Beautiful trip, with nice stops. Definitely recommended."

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Had such a lovely experience doing the Hai Van Pass with brother John & Kyle. Brother John was super helpful, friendly & told us lots of information along the way.

ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"I enjoyed the tour.
The guide speaks a little English and is friendly."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"As a couple in our late 50’s with no experience of motorbikes we were quite nervous about the 90mile trip from Hue to Hoi an. We were picked up on time at 8am from our hotel in Hue, our large holdalls that weighed about 22Kg were sent separately to our chosen hotel in Hoi an and once we’d met up with the two others in our party we were off. We did not take the highway but instead weaved through the labyrinth of paddyfields, stopping every 30mins or so for tea, coffee, water or just an photo opportunity. Duyen and his team were thoughtful and considerate of our needs.
We stopped at waterfalls to swim and lunch just before the Hai Van pass. The pass itself was not as busy as we were expecting with few lorries, mainly bikes and cars so in no way did we feel in any danger on the tight corners. We rode through Da Nang and onto our destination via the Marble mountains. We arrived around 6pm which seems long but we had so many stops it did not seem as though we had been riding all day.
I cannot recommend this tour highly enough. Our pre trip nerves were totally unfounded"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Great experience and is a must for anyone doing the Hai long pass. Peace and love BP out
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Great experience! The tour brought us to a lot of cool places, and the tour guide was awesome! Good value for money"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Was an amazing ride with nice stops along the way! The waterfall was so refreshing before a nice lunch 😊
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Was amazing super friendly and professional. We got a guide was really good took us to all the sites along the way.
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"It was a great tour, the guide was great and made sure we were all safe. Good fun"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Very nice recommendet! John was very friendly and helpful :)
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Highly recommended
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"You won’t be disappointed, very very nice drivers, they will take very good care of you!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Had a great trip with amazing easy riders, made our transfer from Hue to Hoi An very memorable and a true highlight of our trip to Vietnam! The drivers were all very kind and funny, we felt completely safe despite not having ridden on motorbikes before. We made lots of stops along the way for photos and experiences, and for the price it included SO MANY things, the lunch was huge and filling, and the marble mountain tour was very interesting! Would highly recommend to anyone (P.S our luggage was safely transported to hoi an for us also!)"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,We were a group of five and did the Hai van pass tour from Hoi An to Hue. We got one jeep and two easy rider motorbikes. This way everyone could change between sitting in the jeep or on the bikes. We felt very safe with our drivers the whole trip. They stopped at great viewpoints and the time we spent at each stop was enough. The lunch was also great. Really recommend doing this tour with Amazing easy riders!
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"A very nice biker tour. I ride a motorcycle myself and I have to say that I felt very comfortable and safe as a passenger. The drivers arrived at the hotel on time and packed our luggage securely with protective film, which I thought was very nice. We were able to take beautiful photos during the photo stop. We also had good stops for coffee and lunch at the waterfall. I really enjoyed the Vietnamese food. The drivers were always polite and helpful. I'm glad I wasn't driving myself, so I could relax and enjoy the beautiful route from the back.

I would like to thank my driver Duyen again; he was wonderful.

Thank you, thank you. I will never forget this motorcycle trip."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,One of the most wonderful experiences I had in Vietnam. The guys rode very safely and comfortable and showed us very beautiful spots that we would have missed otherwise. Particularly loved the stops in the area of rural Huê where we could experience traditional fishing and agriculture. Definitely an experience not to miss and very recommend.
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"I really can recommend Amazing Easy Riders. Everything was a highlight for me! The drivers were not only very experienced and professional but also incredibly fun! We had a very foggy and rainy day that we did it, but it was absolutely incredible still! The views had ominous feelings and it felt like driving through a movie scene. I never once felt unsafe, eventhough we were driving on a slippery road. They always made sure we felt comfortable and safe with them and were sooo fun to be around with! I would do it again in a heartbeat and can only recommend it to anyone looking for an adventurous way to go from Hue to Hoi An or the other way around, in ANY weather condition. At the end of the day we were a small family and I am so grateful I got to experience this! Thank you so muchhhh to our drivers and wspecially Duyen for being so loving!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"I was doing the Hai Van Pass from Hoi An - excellent communication before the trip.

I had never been on a motorbike before and felt such at ease.

Best tour to date on my holiday, chatted with the locals, great pics, amazing scenery and the food on route 👌.

I was asking alot of random questions along the way and was good to get the local chat, and not a typical sales/tourist pitch.

Would highly recommend!

Thank you for a great day!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"This experience has simply been the most incredible of our time whilst travelling the entirety of south east Asia!

John our guide was amazing, very informative, kind, funny and knows an unbelievable magic trick, so definitely bring some cards!

The route which you will embark on goes through some stunning country roads, the scenery is picture perfect and the fishing village is very interesting with so many facts to learn.

We then headed off to a remote waterfall which was so nice as it was beautiful with no tourists around, after that we headed off to get some lunch which was the nicest lunch we have had in Vietnam, so fresh and was delicious!

After we gorged our delicious lunch we headed to the Hai Van Pass and words cannot describe the beauty of the views which you will encounter, it didn’t matter that the weather wasn’t the best because everything still looked like it was taken from a movie set. Once we reached the peak it was time to head down and have the most scenic drive along the coast to our final destination at the hotel.

This is a must do experience and the only way this should be done is through this company!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"We had the BEST day. It was one of my favourite days so far on our South East Asia trip, even though the weather wasn’t on our side! John went above and beyond to make us feel safe. He was extremely friendly and funny, he made the day as good as it was! I think John might be one of the kindest people we’ve met so far.
The price was extremely good for what we did in the day - we visited a waterfall, had an amazing local lunch, had a coffee, and of course went across the Hai Van Pass. He stopped at all the good view points and made sure we got our photos too. Couldn’t recommend this company enough! A day I’ll never forget!"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Amazing day.
Genuinely one of the best days of our travels so far!
John was so friendly and helped us the entire way! Stopped off for coffees, food etc. (Food was local and so so good! We are very careful with foods but believe me it was unreal)

Many view points which were breath taking!
The value for money was so good as he ended up being so much cheaper that anyone else.

John takes a scenic route and goes on the less busy roads which is great for someone like me with less experience on a bike!
You also get to see the rural side of Hue which is really nice.

10/10 service
10/10 day
10/10 experience

100% recommend"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,Very good bike and service! We rented a bike with Flower in Hoi an and our bag was brought to Hue safe and sound! The bike worked perfect and John (owner of the company) is a very nice and helpful! We gave the bike back and picked up our bags (while John gave us a beer)! He even offered us to bring us to the city centre after. Perfect service and very nice people!
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Had such an amazing day with Ky and Hoang! My friend and I went from Hue to Hoi An on a private tour via Hai Van Pass. We stopped in Da Nang as well. They picked us up at our hotel in Hue and dropped us off at our hotel in Hoi An. They knew all the great photo spots and were so helpful in taking our photos. We asked to stop for ice cream which isn’t part of the tour, but they were happy to. Definitely recommend. 👍🏼"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Duyen is an incredible host and a great character. He was super friendly and very helpful. He even helped us out of a few pickles, which we really appreciated. Thank you Duyen! I would absolutely recommend his company to any travellers."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"Amazing!!
John was such a lovely man, along with his brother Huy. They made sure I had the bike I wanted and called to give advice throughout the ride"
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"I booked the two day tour of Huế to Hội an, and you should too. John is a cheerful, knowledgeable, and honest guide who went out of his way to ensure we felt safe and had a great time."
ChIJRZuBLQGhQTERAKv_iUXeHgQ,"A wonderful tour with John! We (our group consisted of just two people) got to experience Vietnam off the beaten track, drank tea with a family, and had a blast! The tour with Amazing Easy Riders is definitely highly recommended!"

ChIJ_dlUuBqhQTEREknh8HYU7ac,"Hue Traditional Handcrafts Space is a captivating journey into the heart of Hue's rich cultural heritage. More than just a display of artifacts, this exhibition masterfully recreates the atmosphere and spirit of the city's age-old artisan traditions, offering a deeply immersive and educational experience for visitors.
This authenticity brings the crafts to life, allowing visitors to appreciate the skill and dedication required to create each piece.
One of the exhibition's greatest strengths is its focus on the human element. Information panels not only describe the history and techniques of each craft but also share stories about the families and individuals who have preserved these traditions for generations. This personal touch makes the exhibition more than a historical record; it becomes a tribute to the legacy of Hue's master artisans.
Highlights of the exhibition include the stunning display of áo dài weaving, where the intricacy of the brocade patterns is breathtaking, and the section on wood carving, which showcases the incredible precision and artistry of Hue's craftsmen. The scent of incense and the sound of traditional music subtly permeate the air, further enhancing the sensory experience and transporting visitors to the serene and contemplative world of these traditional crafts.
While the exhibition is comprehensive, it maintains a sense of flow and a clear narrative. It beautifully demonstrates how these crafts are not isolated skills but are deeply interwoven with the social, religious, and economic fabric of Hue. The exhibition effectively communicates that these traditions are not relics of the past but a vibrant, living part of Hue's identity today.
In conclusion, the ""Không Gian Nghề Truyền Thống Huế"" is an absolute must-see for anyone interested in Vietnamese culture, history, or craftsmanship. It is a beautifully curated and profoundly moving tribute to the artisans who have shaped Hue's cultural landscape. This exhibition is a testament to the enduring beauty and resilience of traditional crafts and a powerful reminder of the importance of preserving these valuable legacies for future generations."

However, the cultural richness of the space is complemented, and even elevated, by the quality of service. In particular, the kindness of Uyen Thi.

If you want to step beyond the usual tourist experience and witness the quiet mastery of Vietnamese craftsmanship, Không Gian Nghề Truyền Thống Huế is a must-visit. This place is a tribute to Huế’s rich heritage of traditional handicrafts, where skilled artisans keep age-old techniques alive, weaving history into every delicate creation.

The highlight? The iconic nón lá (Vietnamese conical hat), crafted entirely by hand. Watching the process is mesmerizing the meticulous layering of palm leaves, the precise stitching, and the final, artistic touch of hand-painted designs that turn each hat into a work of art. It’s slow, detailed work, requiring both patience and skill, a reminder of the dedication that goes into even the simplest objects in Vietnamese culture.

Beyond hats, the space showcases other traditional crafts, offering a glimpse into the artistry that defines Huế. Whether it’s embroidery, wood carving, or lacquerware, everything here reflects a deep respect for time-honored techniques.

If you appreciate craftsmanship, history, or just want a unique souvenir with real cultural value, this place is worth your time. It’s not just about buying something it’s about understanding the hands and stories behind it."

ChIJzy9JnbWmQTERSp2cqyaNxng,"Beautiful, worth experiencing Da Vien Bridge is one of the important bridges spanning the Perfume River, connecting the two banks of Hue city. With a modern design but still in harmony with the poetic landscape of the ancient capital, this bridge not only plays a traffic role but is also a notable architectural highlight.

Da Vien Bridge began construction in 2009 and was officially inaugurated on August 31, 2012. Initially, the bridge was called Bach Ho road bridge, but after consulting with the people, the People's Council of Thua Thien Hue province decided to change the name to Da Vien Bridge. This bridge is 542.5 meters long, 24.5 meters wide, with four lanes and two sidewalks for pedestrians. In particular, on the bridge there are six gazebos, where people and tourists can stop to admire the romantic Huong River view.

Aesthetically, Da Vien Bridge has a modern style but still retains elegance, consistent with the ancient beauty of Hue. When standing on the bridge, visitors can admire the panoramic view of the Perfume River, with dragon boats floating slowly, creating a beautiful natural picture. At night, the artistic lighting system on the bridge adds to the shimmering and magical look of this place.

Not only is it an important transportation project, Da Vien bridge also contributes to promoting tourism and the local economy. With its location near the city center, this bridge makes traveling between areas more convenient, while also creating conditions for cultural and tourist activities to develop strongly."

Origin: Cast by King Minh Mang in 1835, consisting of 9 large bronze urns symbolizing the sustainability and longevity of the dynasty.

Meaning: Each urn bears the name of a king from Gia Long to Minh Mang and is associated with symbolic images of nature and Vietnam such as mountains, rivers, seas, animals, plants, etc. Through that, the Nine Dynastic Urns both demonstrate the power of the dynasty and are a ""visual history"" depicting the beautiful country.

Architecture: Each urn weighs about 2,000 to 2,600 kg, cast from a solid block of bronze, placed on a green stone pedestal, exquisitely carved with nearly 162 images of landscapes, plants, animals, and artifacts associated with Vietnam.

• Location: The Nine Urns are placed in a horizontal row in front of Hien Lam Pavilion and The Mieu Temple, creating a solemn and majestic space.

👉 The Nine Urns can be seen as a symbol of the national spirit, the wealth and stability of the country under the Nguyen Dynasty"

ChIJgYPRdDOhQTER7b-_Q7QechA,"Standing proudly in front of the Thế Miếu (Temple of Generations), these colossal bronze urns were cast in 1835 under Emperor Minh Mạng. Inspired by China’s ancient Nine Tripod Cauldrons, they symbolise the Nguyễn Dynasty’s power, unity, and Vietnam’s rich heritage.

Seven of these are the largest and most elaborate, dedicated to the dynasty’s most prominent emperors. Each one is a masterpiece — engraved with mountains, rivers, animals, and celestial symbols, telling the story of a nation in bronze.

Commissioned by Emperor Minh Mạng and placed in front of the Thế Miếu.
Each is named after the posthumous title of an emperor and decorated with 17–33 engraved motifs showing Vietnam’s geography, fauna, flora, and celestial symbols.

Cao Đỉnh is the largest, representing the founder Gia Long, weighing over 2,600 kg.

Each urn is positioned in a specific order in front of the ancestral temple, symbolising a lineage of power.

The engravings act like a bronze encyclopaedia of 19th-century Vietnam — mapping its geography, recording its flora and fauna, and preserving cultural icons.

They have survived multiple wars, including the destruction of much of the Imperial City during the 20th century.

Each weighs up to 2,600 kg — a monument not just to emperors, but to an entire nation’s history and resilience.

ChIJgYPRdDOhQTER7b-_Q7QechA,"The Nine Tripods were cast during the Minh Mang era (1835-1837) and placed in front of the Thien An Temple in the Hue Imperial City (built in the 19th century and dedicated to successive Nguyen Dynasty emperors), symbolizing the emperor's life. By order of Emperor Minh Mang, the Nine Tripods were named after the posthumous titles of successive Nguyen Dynasty emperors. They are Gao Ding, Ren Ding, Zhang Ding, Ying Ding, Nghi Ding, Chun Ding, Xuan Ding, Yu Ding, and Xuan Ding, representing the sacred artifacts that embody the nation's eternal prosperity and unification.

The nine bronze tripods are similar in shape. The one on the right side of the neck is dated ""the end of the 16th year of Minh Mang"" (1835) and completed ""the beginning of the 18th year of Minh Mang"" (1837). The weight of each tripod is recorded on the left side, ranging from 3201 jin to 4307 jin. The body of the tripod is meticulously carved with 162 inscriptions, including motifs from early 19th-century Vietnamese maps, such as the East Sea carved on Cao Dinh Island, the South Sea carved on Nhen Dinh Island, and the West Sea carved on Zhang Dinh Island.

China's Nine Tripods are said to have been first cast during the reign of Emperor Yu of Xia (circa 21st century BC) to symbolize the unification of the Nine Provinces. However, the actual objects have been lost, leaving only records describing their form. The tripod has long been a symbol of the Chinese nation's legitimacy (see the classic ""Quest for the Tripod in the Central Plains""), symbolizing the Mandate of Heaven and the center of royal power, not the sole domain of any single individual. Archaeologically recovered bronze tripods are often treasured artifacts in ancestral temples, adorned with either Taotie motifs or inscriptions. They were displayed in the imperial chambers or offered in sacrificial offerings. By the Shang and Zhou dynasties, the use of tripods and vessels gradually became ritualistic, with some being buried as funerary objects in tombs. Their significance lay in demonstrating authority and connecting people with the gods.

The Nine Tripods of the Hue Imperial City in Vietnam are displayed in the grounds of the King Thame Shrine and are used as sacrificial vessels in Tu Duc Hall. These tripods are uniquely significant: each dedicated to a different emperor is inscribed with his posthumous title, highlighting his achievements and accomplishments, demonstrating both the legitimacy of the succession and the continuity of the royal legacy. Each of the nine tripods bears a prestigious name and is adorned with relief carvings reminiscent of cartographic narratives, resembling miniature versions of the Golden Ou. Their craftsmanship embodies the cultural essence of the Nguyen Dynasty of Vietnam, using the carvings of the mountains and rivers to proclaim the enduring strength of the territory and the spirit of the Vietnamese nation. They are precious instruments that uphold both political and cultural traditions.

The workshop where the tripods were cast is said to be located in Phường Đúc, a village on the southern shore of the Hong Kong River, about three miles from Hue City, on the roadside near the Gia Vien Bridge. This area is the source of copper art in central Vietnam, and only this village remains today. Its craftsmanship, inherited from ancient methods, has survived wars and destruction. This is not only a rare and extant document, but also a model for bronze casting in Hue and throughout Vietnam, demonstrating the exquisite craftsmanship of the Gia Long and Minh Mang eras. On May 8, 2024, at the 10th session of the UNESCO Memory of the World Asia-Pacific Committee, the Hue Palace Nine Tripods Archive was inscribed on the Memory of the World Asia-Pacific Register, a true testament to Vietnamese culture."

The Nine Tripod Cauldrons of Hue are not just simple bronze cauldrons but also unique works of art, containing many profound meanings about Vietnamese history and culture?

Cast in the 19th century under the reign of King Minh Mang, the Nine Tripod Cauldrons are placed in the courtyard in front of The To Mieu, Hue Imperial City. Each cauldron has its own name and is decorated with sophisticated patterns, symbolizing the virtues of the people and the prosperity of the country."
ChIJgYPRdDOhQTER7b-_Q7QechA,"Cửu Đỉnh(Nine Dynastic Urns) is a remarkable symbol in my heart 🩷🩷🩷🩷 and for the Nguyễn Dynasty, located in the courtyard of the Thế Miếu(Temple of Generations) within the Imperial City of Huế. These nine bronze urns were cast under the reign of Emperor Minh Mạng in 1835 and are one of the most poetic, symbolic, and historically significant artifacts of the Nguyễn court. They are not only physical representations of the dynasty’s power and longevity but also deeply woven into Vietnamese art, poetry, and historical narratives.

Poetry in Bronze:
The creation of Cửu Đỉnh is itself an act of artistry and imagination. Each urn represents one of the Nguyễn emperors and is adorned with intricately carved images reflecting various aspects of the empire’s geography, culture, and natural beauty. The carvings depict mountains, rivers, animals, plants, and even historical battles, capturing the essence of the land the Nguyễn rulers governed. Each image has its own story, and together they form a detailed tapestry of Vietnam’s landscape and heritage.

The poetic element of the Cửu Đỉnh is found not only in its visual design but also in its symbolism. In Confucian tradition, an urn or cauldron (đỉnh) is a powerful representation of authority and governance. The nine urns, standing tall and immovable, are metaphors for the unshakable rule of the dynasty and the emperor’s deep connection to the land and its people. This sense of permanence and cultural richness has made them a recurring theme in poetry, literature, and art.

Inspiration for Art and Culture:
The Cửu Đỉnh has been immortalized in many forms of Vietnamese art, including poetry, painting, and music. Artists have long been inspired by the grandeur of these urns and the natural imagery they display. Poets often used them as a metaphor for the lasting legacy of the Nguyễn Dynasty, drawing connections between the power of nature and the resilience of the emperors who ruled Vietnam.

In traditional Vietnamese music, references to the Cửu Đỉnh evoke a sense of nostalgia and reverence for a bygone era. The peaceful and dignified presence of the urns in the heart of the Imperial City has been likened to the calm and wisdom of the emperors themselves, providing an emotional depth to many compositions.

Historical Significance:
Beyond their beauty, the Cửu Đỉnh also serve as historical documents, representing the Nguyễn Dynasty’s efforts to record their reign and connect it to the vast history of Vietnam. Each urn is dedicated to one emperor, from Gia Long, the dynasty’s founder, to later rulers. Together, they signify the lineage and continuity of the Nguyễn Dynasty, a dynasty that lasted over 140 years.

During the Nguyễn era, these urns were regarded as symbols of the empire's stability and prosperity. They were a statement of Vietnam’s sovereignty, crafted during a time when the country was asserting its strength amidst both internal challenges and foreign influence.

Romantic Legacy in History and Art:
The Cửu Đỉnhcontinues to stir emotions not only as historical artifacts but as a living part of Vietnam’s cultural identity. For many, the image of the nine majestic urns standing in serene silence within the Imperial Citadel serves as a powerful reminder of the fleeting nature of power, but also of the enduring nature of beauty and legacy. These urns are more than just physical relics; they embody the spirit of an era in Vietnamese history and the poetry that is drawn from the connection between ruler, land, and people.

Whether captured in a painting, referenced in a poem, or admired by visitors to Huế, the Cửu Đỉnh has left an indelible mark on Vietnamese culture. It bridges the gap between the grandeur of the past and the contemplation of the present, embodying a poetic tranquility that has survived through the ages, making them not only a relic of a glorious dynasty but a continuing source of inspiration for generations to come."

Emperor Minh Mang ordered the casting of these nine majestic bronze urns to commemorate the first nine emperors of the Nguyen Dynasty.  They were then cast between the years 1835 and 1837.

The one in the middle of the nine is the most ornate, as it commemorates the Founding Emperor of Nguyen Dynasty, Gia Long.  Each of the urn bears the posthumous title for the respective Emperor.  The Cao urn  of 1835 commemorating Gia Long has the name “Cao” meaning height.  It weighs 2,604kg as the most prominent urn out of the nine.

As with many other features of the Imperial Enclosure, these nine urns are also testament to the Vietnamese royalties’ respect of ancient China.  The existence of the nine urns certainly echoes the nine urns of the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties, which were the earliest Chinese dynasties (during the Bronze Age) in history.  During this time in the 19th Century, bronze was a particularly precious metal in Vietnam.

The three-storied structure right at the courtyard of the Nine Dynastic Urns is the Famous Soul Porch, (Hien Lam Cac), built in 1821.

The Nine Urns are statues symbolizing the ruling power of the monarchy.

Each urn has a separate name corresponding to a posthumous name of each Nguyen Dynasty emperor, respectively: Cao urns, Nhan urns, Chuong urns, Anh urns, Nghi urns, Thuan urns, Tuyen urns, Du urns, Huyen urns.

The Cao urns correspond to the altar and shrine of King Nguyen The To (King Gia Long), placed in the middle of the Nine Urns and are the only urns moved forward 3 meters with the meaning of honoring the founding king of the dynasty.

In general, all nine urns have the same general shape: round, narrow neck, flared mouth, two handles on the mouth, three legs below the urns. On the neck of the cauldron, on the right side, the year of casting is inscribed as “Minh Mang 16th year At Mui”, which is the year 1835.

The sizes and weights of the urns are not the same. Cao Dinh is 2.5m high and weighs 2601kg - it is the highest and heaviest urn. Huyen Dinh is 2.31m high and weighs 1935kg - it is the lowest and lightest urn. Around the side of each urn are carved 17 scenes. Thus, there are 153 scenes embossed on the Nine Urns. These are images of mountains, rivers, moons, stars, trees, flowers, animals, weapons, vehicles, boats, etc. We can see those 153 carvings as 153 paintings.

ChIJq3G3BzuhQTERfnUyGO323K8,"Nguyễn Đình Chiểu Walking Street in Huế is a hidden gem that offers a delightful mix of local charm, culture, and relaxation right in the heart of the city. I spent an evening here during my recent trip to Huế and was absolutely enchanted by its peaceful ambiance and riverside beauty.

Stretching along the Perfume River, this walking street is smaller and more intimate than some of the more commercial pedestrian streets in Vietnam, but that’s exactly what makes it special. It’s clean, well-maintained, and has a uniquely calm and romantic atmosphere — especially around sunset, when the sky turns golden and reflects off the water.

What I appreciated most was the blend of local life and gentle tourism. You’ll find local families taking walks, street performers playing traditional Vietnamese instruments, and small stalls selling art, souvenirs, and light snacks. There are also several charming cafés and teahouses where you can sit and enjoy the view while sipping a cold drink or Vietnamese coffee.

The street is beautifully lit in the evening, with colorful lanterns and tasteful lighting that enhances the cozy and poetic feel. It’s the perfect place to take a leisurely stroll, unwind after a day of sightseeing, or just people-watch and feel the rhythm of Huế.

If you’re visiting Huế, don’t miss this spot. Nguyễn Đình Chiểu Walking Street is the kind of place that doesn’t try too hard — it simply lets Huế’s gentle soul speak for itself. Five stars without a doubt."

The LED-lit bridges and river breeze create a peaceful backdrop for strolling, people-watching, or catching impromptu street performances.

The street is compact but full of character—ideal for a short walk or a casual night out. It’s pedestrian-only, making it safe and quiet compared to busier city zones. Locals gather for music, games, and evening hangouts, while visitors enjoy the mix of food stalls, art displays, and photo spots.

ChIJjXLVm4mhQTERhvCpafPrFic,"Located in the heart of Hue city, Hue ironwood bridge (or Hue walking bridge) is located on the southern bank of the poetic Huong River and lies between Truong Tien Bridge and the famous Phu Xuan Bridge of Hue. If you do not know, this bridge is an architectural work symbolizing the friendship between Vietnam and Korea, fully sponsored by KOICA with an investment capital of 6 million USD and completed in November 2018. By 2019, Hue ironwood bridge was officially put into operation to serve the community. 

In addition, Hue ironwood bridge is also a point to extend the walking route on the Huong River starting from Nguyen Dinh Chieu Walking Street to Ly Tu Trong Park. Hue ironwood bridge is nearly 400 m long - 4 m wide, a combination of brown wood and copper yellow, extremely interesting and unique. The bridge is made of 100% imported high-quality ironwood from South Africa, so it is extremely moisture-resistant and strong. In addition, the ironwood bridge has a railing system made of 4,100 beautiful golden-colored copper bars imported from Korea, weighing more than 7 tons, creating interesting highlights as well as providing a solid structure for the bridge. In particular, this bridge is also equipped with a waterproof electrical and lighting system, so even if it is submerged in water 4 meters deep, the bridge will still operate normally."

When I left, a security guard charged me 5k even though I went in at 1pm. 5k and 2k are not really worth much, but the feeling of being cheated made me feel like all the beautiful scenery on the river was gone! Not to mention how foreigners would be ripped off. I hope Vietnamese people will become more honest and provide decent tourism services.

ChIJu6CHTTGhQTERczjdMfgCKvA,"As I walked through the streets of Hue with a 50,000 dong banknote in hand, I never imagined I'd find a place where I could see the exact same view depicted on the note. I found it south of the Flag Tower, facing the Huong River.

The building in the foreground depicted on the note is Chi Man Lou, Nguyen Luong Dien in the background, and the Imperial Ping Phong Mountain towering in the background. When I saw the scene before my eyes and compared it to the note, it was exactly the same. I was so moved that I stared at it for a while.

According to the explanation, Chi Man Lou was once a place where decrees of the Nguyen Dynasty and the results of the imperial examinations were announced to the public. Nguyen Luong Dien was a building where the emperor used to cool off, and Imperial Ping Phong Mountain is a mountain that is said to attract good energy to Hue according to feng shui. Learning the significance of each building and mountain made me realize that it's not just beautiful scenery, but is deeply connected to the history of the dynasty and the lives of its people, making it even more fascinating.

If you visit Hue, why not bring along a 50,000 dong banknote and stand at the Shih Man Tower? Comparing it with the banknote will surely be an unforgettable experience."

The lower floor is a high platform, open on all four sides, creating a wide view; the upper floor is a square four-roofed building, with softly curved roof corners, and gilded wooden pillars. 

Not only having administrative and informational value in the feudal period, Phu Van Lau is also a cultural symbol of the ancient capital. This place has witnessed many important events, reflecting the political and social life of the Nguyen Dynasty.

Phu Van Lau was built in 1819 under Gia Long's reign, initially as a place to post the king's edicts and orders, and later became a highlight with special historical and cultural value.

The building has delicate and elegant architecture, with two floors of glass-tiled roofs, eight ironwood columns supporting the roof, and the surrounding area open to all four sides. I really like the simplicity and elegance of Phu Van Lau, not too massive but majestic, reminiscent of a golden age. Standing from here, I can see the Perfume River, Ky Dai, and in the distance Truong Tien Bridge, all blending into a picture of Hue.

If you have the opportunity to come to Hue, I recommend stopping by Phu Van Lau to feel the nostalgic space, take some souvenir photos, or simply sit quietly watching the flow of people passing by, listening to the temple bells ringing in the distance.

ChIJ8QMxaQWkQTERoEfHn0_2BRE,Bunkers could do with a clean out !
ChIJ8QMxaQWkQTERoEfHn0_2BRE,"These fortified defensive structures are called bunkers, built mainly of concrete and brick, with a simple but sturdy design, to withstand attacks and protect troops during the resistance war against the French. The architecture of bunkers is usually rectangular or square, with entrances designed discreetly to avoid enemy detection. Inside, the space is quite limited, only enough for a few soldiers to shelter and carry out combat activities. Many artifacts have been found in these bunkers, including weapons, ammunition and military living utensils. The bunkers on Vong Canh hill are also associated with many interesting folk stories. One of the prominent stories is about a soldier who died here, said to have become a spirit to protect this area. Local people often recall that on moonlit nights, the soldiers' whispers can be heard, as a reminder of the nation's painful but also proud past. This is a unique architectural work, when walking around Vong Canh hill, remember not to miss this important historical relic area."

The bunkers themselves were worth exploring, but the view of the river and road made it clear why two bunkers were built here, a strategically important location. Motorbike parking is available at the park entrance and in the open space to the side. The bunkers themselves are inaccessible and are overgrown with undergrowth. Vietnamese people seem to enjoy this park as a comfortable place to enjoy drinking, dancing, and other activities."

ChIJ8QMxaQWkQTERoEfHn0_2BRE,"Vong Canh Hill in Van Nien area. During the reign of King Tu Duc, it was chosen as a place to view the Perfume River (or since the reign of King Thieu Tri?) and has gradually changed.
The hill area has been cleared and widened, the pine trees are also taller and denser, making the hill's scenery cool even in the hot noon, but also partially covering the river view, and somewhat covering the main purpose of the hill's name: Vong Canh.
I don't know which direction the hill will face in the future! To create Vong Canh, it should create a more open space, so that you can see further from the hill; or to make a park, there should be many places to rest, entertain... and lose the meaning of Vong Canh."

ChIJ_f52qGqhQTER1DiQ_bSUgM0,"I just had a very interesting experience at An Dinh Palace and want to share it with everyone. Built in the early 20th century, this palace not only has a special architectural beauty but also contains interesting historical stories. 

The first impression of this place is its splendid appearance, not inferior to any mansion in Europe. The architecture has a neoclassical style mixed with a bit of Asian style, making me feel like I have gone back in time to the prosperous period of the Nguyen Dynasty. The decorative details are very sophisticated, from the sculptures to the patterns on the walls. The interior is equally impressive, with galleries and living spaces that satisfy both aesthetics and history. 

One thing I feel a bit regretful about is that the number of visitors is quite large on weekends, so sometimes it feels a bit crowded. However, this does not reduce the attractiveness of An Dinh Palace. If possible, you should choose a mid-week visit, you will certainly have the opportunity to enjoy the space more fully.

Along the way to the palace, the green landscape with rows of ancient trees makes me feel comfortable and want to spend more time here. Overall, this is a pretty good destination for those who love to explore historical architecture and want to learn more about Hue culture. It is worth visiting at least once."

- Opening hours: 7:00 am - 5:30 pm daily.
- Located on Phan Dinh Phung Street, only 3km from the center of Hue City, easy to get to by taxi or motorbike.
- The outside has ancient yellow walls, elaborate motifs; inside is a splendid gold-plated living room, European-style frescoed ceiling.
- Some artifacts do not have captions or audio guides, so the experience is somewhat limited if you want to understand the history in depth.. Avoid touching the artifacts, moms

This is a beautiful historical site, small in scale, just right to visit in 1 hour, suitable for those who do not have much time.

The guards here are friendly and enthusiastic. The ticket purchase and visit process is also neat and quick, you can come and buy tickets on the spot, no need to book in advance. The guards sell drinks and snacks at the gate, everyone can buy to support.

It is a bit regrettable that some of the displayed artifacts have no explanation; there is also no audio included, so it is a bit confusing when visiting. Hopefully it will be upgraded in the future.

Note: One thing that is a bit inconvenient is that many people come to take pictures, bring their crew and equipment, encroach on the hallways and stairs to take pictures; greatly affecting the visiting experience. I am very sad that a beautiful relic is being marketed as a place to take pictures instead of a place to contemplate history. Anyway, I went between 9 and 11 am, people can refer to this to avoid the crowded time to take pictures."

ChIJ_f52qGqhQTER1DiQ_bSUgM0,"I visited An Dinh Palace and was really surprised because this building is more beautiful than I thought. Although not as large as the Imperial City, the architecture is extremely unique - a combination of Asian and European styles. The palace facade with prominent golden patterns, takes very luxurious pictures. 

Inside there is an exhibition area of ​​​​documentary photos about the Nguyen Dynasty, especially about King Khai Dinh and Queen Nam Phuong. Walking slowly to look at each photo, I feel like I am returning to an old historical period, both romantic and full of worries. 

The space here is quiet, not crowded, so visiting is quite comfortable. Personally, what I like most is the nostalgic feeling, standing in the middle of an old palace that still has its majesty, like hearing the breath of a golden age. If you have come to Hue and want to find a place that is both beautiful and full of stories, An Dinh Palace is worth visiting."

The building looks really nice from the front; I also like the yellow color. Inside, there's a small exhibition spread over two floors and a larger area at the back.

If you have the opportunity to visit Hue, do not miss An Dinh Palace, a beautiful architectural work of the Nguyen Dynasty, where the antiquity and sophistication in every detail will captivate you at first sight.

An Dinh Palace was built in the early 20th century under King Khai Dinh, as the residence of the royal family, especially King Khai Dinh and King Bao Dai after his abdication. This work bears the mark of Asian-European cultural exchange, expressed through sophisticated architecture with a combination of Western classical elements and Vietnamese traditions.

The highlight of An Dinh Palace is Khai Tuong Palace, a 3-storey building with elaborately carved walls, meticulous paintings and a space filled with light through stained glass windows. This was once a place where photography was completely prohibited, but now, after many renovations, you can freely visit and capture impressive moments here.

The vast grounds of An Dinh Palace, surrounded by trees and colorful flower beds, create a peaceful space, completely separate from the modern life outside. In addition to Khai Tuong Palace, you can learn more about the history of the Nguyen Dynasty through other areas such as the crescent lake, the main gate with its artistic architecture, or the remaining relics. 

📍 Address: 179 Phan Dinh Phung, Phu Nhuan Ward, Hue City. 
⏰ Opening hours: 7:30 am - 5:30 pm daily. 
💸 Entrance fee: About 50,000 VND/person. 

If you love the nostalgic beauty and want to listen to interesting historical stories, An Dinh Palace is definitely a destination not to be missed in your journey to explore the ancient capital of Hue. Come visit and feel the wonderful intersection between time and space here!"

They guided us to buy tickets and let us leave some of our belongings. Tickets for out-of-towners are 50k/person and for Hue people are 25k/person. The Palace is not very large, but in return, there are very classy check-in corners, royal, classic, and rcm style. You should wear silk dresses. You should go around noon when there are fewer people. Going inside the Palace at noon is still cool, there are fans, and especially at that time there are few people taking pictures. The flower garden behind is also very beautiful to take pictures. If you think the Imperial City is too large, you should go to the Palace."
ChIJ_f52qGqhQTER1DiQ_bSUgM0,"An Dinh Palace is a great destination to explore Hue's history and architecture.

Nothing special, and it's off the main tourist trail."
ChIJ_f52qGqhQTER1DiQ_bSUgM0,"This palace has a unique blend of Asian and European architecture, marking the history of the Nguyen Dynasty over a century. Built in 1902 under King Thanh Thai, An Dinh Palace was originally the private residence of King Khai Dinh. In 1917, the king renovated the palace in a modern style, completed in 1919, creating a masterpiece of neoclassical architecture. The palace was then transferred to Crown Prince Vinh Thuy (King Bao Dai) in 1922. This was also where King Bao Dai's family lived after the August Revolution in 1945, before Lady Tu Cung donated the palace to the revolutionary government. Recognized by UNESCO as a World Cultural Heritage, An Dinh Palace is not only an architectural work but also a witness to the ups and downs of Vietnamese history, associated with figures such as King Khai Dinh, King Bao Dai and Queen Nam Phuong. Truly overwhelmed by the subtle blend of modern Roman style and traditional Vietnamese motifs. From the outside, the main gate is two stories, decorated with embossed porcelain and glass, appearing splendid with dragons, phoenixes and sophisticated patterns. Trung Lap Communal House has an octagonal structure and an ancient roof. The most prominent is Khai Tuong Tower, a three-story building with an elaborately carved facade, combining oriental motifs such as the four sacred animals, the eight treasures and European styles such as angels and the North Star. The first floor of Khai Tuong Tower displays six oil paintings depicting the Nguyen Dynasty tombs, which are valuable works of art, while the Cuu Tu Dai Theater was destroyed in 1947. The campus is very large, surrounded by moss-covered yellow walls, creating a luxurious and ancient beauty. This place used to be the setting for famous movies such as Gai Gia Lam Chieu or the MV Khong The Cung Anh Suot Kiep by singer Hoa Minzy, recreating the tragic stories of Queen Nam Phuong. Walking around the palace, every little corner here tells a story, from the exquisite murals to the quiet space, making me feel like I'm lost in a golden age."

ChIJ1wFe7FOlQTERFjNFcQ-6o_k,"Quite nice to see, but really only worth a quick stop. All the shops—as expected—offer the same things. We bought a pack of lemongrass sticks for 50,000 VND. Our two older children even got to roll a stick themselves."

ChIJ1wFe7FOlQTERFjNFcQ-6o_k,
ChIJ1wFe7FOlQTERFjNFcQ-6o_k,"It's actually a street lined with shops selling incense. Each offers photo opportunities, some more photogenic than the others. Some even show you how the incense stick is made.
Don't buy more than 30,000 VND for a pack of incense (for one pack, that's 120,000 VND for four). For a small wooden box of incense, no more than 70,000 VND. Prices are found in shops in town.
Aside from this photogenic aspect, the only attraction of the site is that the Tu Duc tomb is just a few minutes' walk away, so you can combine a visit to this village with a visit to the tomb."

ChIJ1wFe7FOlQTERFjNFcQ-6o_k,"Just a street full of the same kind of incense shops. Most sales people are really pushy and unpleasant. More of a set up tourist scene than a workshop. Not worth the effort and grab costs.
We went to a quiet shop with a shy worker. She demonstrated incense making without asking or pushing something. Let you smell different incenses. Had a pleasant experience. Start price for a wooden box to burn incense was 150k, at popular big shop was 300k. A plastic tube of herbal incense without wooden stick 100k. Better quality than regular incense used at tempels. Mild smell and cleaner burning.
A pack of regular incense lemongrass scent 80k. Fresh strong smell. Both is different than the Indian incense. Price is negotiatable. Making pictures in shop after purchase was free of charge."
ChIJ1wFe7FOlQTERFjNFcQ-6o_k,"Lovely and colourful.

It’s a quick visit but worth it if you’re nearby — a lively splash of colour and culture on the way to the tombs or pagodas."

The finished sticks are packaged to preserve the scent of the product.
The process is a joy to watch, approaching the village you see the sticks being sorted prepared and drying in the open along the paths and any available space. It is a quaint place and worth a visit if of interest, I use quite a bit of incense at home so it was a joy to see.
It was busy with Instagramers getting the perfect picture."

ChIJ1wFe7FOlQTERFjNFcQ-6o_k,Had a good try here and certainly a unique experience. Found that buying incense here is a lot more expensive than buying in town so don’t let the ladies fool you :)
ChIJ1wFe7FOlQTERFjNFcQ-6o_k,"Specifically for tourists. A street lined with incense sticks. When I was there, I happily took photos, but no one wanted any money. I ended up buying something and definitely overpaid. But I didn't bargain, as I thought it was still cheap enough. There's a great little café around the corner."

Just stop by to support a few small, pretty items like souvenirs or a cool glass of sugarcane juice and you can comfortably take photos in a super beautiful space, without having to pay any extra fees. It seems like they rent ao dai, Vietnamese costumes for 50k/set or something, I haven't experienced this service so I'm not very familiar with it. But the prices at this shop are reasonable, they don't rip off tourists, the place is also spacious and comfortable, I think the display area for customers to take photos is larger than other shops. 

The best is the owner: extremely cute, super enthusiastic. Guide how to pose with a stylist's heart, lend conical hats, fans, props for free, and even take photos with the customer's phone, and every angle is ""profitable"". 

Every time I go to Hue, I have to stop by here because of the sincerity and kindness of the owners. People like the owners make tourism more beautiful, leaving behind an unforgettable warm feeling. Anyone who comes to Hue and wants to have a memorable experience and beautiful photos to bring back, should definitely stop by!

ChIJbYXDWDGhQTERSBKt9-VYIjI,"The Flag Tower (Kỳ Đài) is a historic building in Hue, the ancient capital of central Vietnam, and one of the city's symbols.

Overview and Features:

Name: It is also known as Kỳ Đài (Flag Stand) or Cột cờ Kinh thành Huế (Hue Imperial Palace Flagpole). In English, it is called the Flag Tower.

Location: It is located in the center of the south side of Hue Imperial Palace (Hue Citadel, Great Interior), in front of the Mercury Gate (Ngọ Môn).

History: It was built in 1807 during the reign of Emperor Gia Long (Gia Long), the first emperor of the Nguyen Dynasty, at the same time as the Royal Palace.

Composition:

Base: It consists of a three-tiered, gabled brick base. These three tiers, from top to bottom, represent ""Heaven,"" ""Earth,"" and ""Man,"" and are said to be based on the Confucian idea of ​​the Three Principles. The entire base is approximately 17.5 meters tall.

Flagpole: Originally made of wood, it was repeatedly destroyed and damaged by typhoons and war, and the current one was rebuilt in 1948 or 1969 out of reinforced concrete. Including the flagpole, it is approximately 37 meters or 29 meters tall (depending on the source), and can be seen from anywhere in the city.

Function: During the Nguyen Dynasty, a flag was hoisted here to send signals to the Imperial Court during festivals, ceremonies, and emergencies.

Historical Significance: At important turning points in Vietnam's history, particularly its independence from France and the end of the Vietnam War, the Vietnamese flag (a red flag with a yellow star) was hoisted atop the pagoda, making it a symbolic site of these historic moments. The Vietnamese flag still flies there today.
For many tourists visiting Hue, the palace is an important attraction that gives a sense of the city's history along with its majesty."
ChIJbYXDWDGhQTERSBKt9-VYIjI,"The flagpole is built in the middle of the South side of Hue Citadel, within the Nam Chanh Fortress. This is considered the place where the royal flag is hung. Hue Flagpole was built along with other structures in the Imperial City in the 6th year of Gia Long, i.e. 1807, and underwent many renovations in 1829, 1831, and 1840. Over time, Hue Flagpole has witnessed many changes of the country. Hue Citadel Flagpole consists of 2 main parts: the flagpole and the flagpole. The flagpole consists of 3 truncated floors stacked on top of each other. The 1st floor is over 5.5m high, the 2nd floor is about 6m high, and the 3rd floor is over 6m high. The total height of the flagpole is 17.5m. On the left of the flagpole, there is a small path to go up. At the top of each floor, there is a 1m railing, decorated with hollow tiles, and there is also a rainwater drainage system."
ChIJbYXDWDGhQTERSBKt9-VYIjI,"🏠 Introduction

The Hue Imperial City Flagpole (also known as the Hue Ky Dai) is one of the important historical and cultural symbols of the ancient capital. Located right in front of Ngo Mon Gate, the flagpole was built during the reign of King Gia Long in 1807 and was the place where the national flag was hung during important ceremonies of the Nguyen Dynasty.

🏯 Architecture & Landscape

The flagpole consists of three sturdy brick platforms and a steel pole nearly 37 meters high. Standing here, you can have a panoramic view of the Hue Imperial City, the Perfume River and Truong Tien Bridge in the distance. In the morning or at sunset, the sunlight shines on the red flag with a yellow star fluttering in the sky, creating an extremely majestic and proud scene.

📜 Historical Value

The flagpole is not only an architectural work but also a witness to history. During the Nguyen Dynasty and the resistance period, this place was the command point, where the flag was hung to affirm national sovereignty. Today, the flagpole still flies the national flag - the sacred symbol of Vietnam.

👩‍💼 Sightseeing experience

Visitors can easily visit when visiting Hue Imperial City. The surrounding area is clean, spacious, and has many beautiful photo angles. In particular, at night, the flagpole area is brightly lit, creating a solemn yet poetic atmosphere.

⭐ Conclusion

The Hue Imperial City Flagpole is a sacred, ancient, and proud symbol of the ancient capital. If you come to Hue, you should definitely stop here to feel the historical spirit and the majestic beauty of the heritage land."

Located in the complex of relics of the Ancient Capital, it is one of the bright spots of tourism in Hue, attracting many domestic and foreign ""travelers"" to visit every year. Ky Dai was officially built in the 6th year of Gia Long (Dinh Mao year 1807). At first, it was simple, but until the reign of King Minh Mang, it was continuously renovated many times in 1829, 1831 and 1840. At that time, on the occasion of ceremonies, welcoming the tour or urgent reports, Ky Dai had regulations on flag signals. On top of the flagpole, there is also an observation post called Vong Dau, from time to time the guards have to climb up and use the Thien Ly telescope to observe the coast."

ChIJbYXDWDGhQTERSBKt9-VYIjI,"The Hue flagpole (flagpole) was first built by Gia Long in 1807, originally a wooden pole nearly 30m high. Later, Thieu Tri replaced it with a wooden pole 32m high in 1846. In 1904, the flagpole was destroyed by a storm. Thanh Thai had the flagpole recast from a cast iron pipe. In 1947, the French occupied Hue and shot down the flagpole. In 1948, the flagpole was rebuilt from concrete, 37m high. 

Reading before 1945x, the flagpole was used to hang the Ly flag of the Nguyen Dynasty and also served as an observation tower and watchtower. In 1945, Bao Dai abdicated, the red flag with yellow star of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam flew on the Hue flagpole. In 1947, France established the Republic of Vietnam and invited Bao Dai to be the head of state. The flag of the Republic of Vietnam was replaced. In 1968, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam captured the Flag Tower and replaced the flag for 28 days before the Army of the Republic of Vietnam recaptured it. In 1975, with the victory of the Hue - Da Nang Campaign, the red flag with the yellow star officially flew on the Flag Tower until today."

It was heartbreaking to learn that this tower once served as both a lookout post and a gun battery, becoming a fierce battleground between the Viet Cong and US forces. Hearing that the flag was replaced so many times during the Tet Offensive in particular brought the fierce fighting back to mind. Seeing the bullet holes still visible on the walls brought home the tragedy of war.

The approximately 17-meter-tall pedestal is also distinctive, with three levels. The top section represents ""heaven,"" the middle section represents ""earth,"" and the bottom section represents ""man,"" and this is apparently based on the ideas of the Chinese philosopher Xunzi. In addition to this pagoda, there are many other Nguyen Dynasty buildings in Hue that have three-tiered bases, so I'd like to keep an eye out for them when I visit other historical sites in the future."

ChIJbYXDWDGhQTERSBKt9-VYIjI,"**Ky Dai** is a large flagpole located in the middle of the front of Ngo Mon Gate, in the Imperial Citadel of Hue, considered a majestic symbol of the Nguyen Dynasty capital. The project was built in 1807 under the reign of King Gia Long, then restored, enhanced and completed by the reigns of King Minh Mang, Thieu Tri and Dong Khanh. 

Ky Dai consists of two main parts: **flag tower** and **flag pole**. 

* **Flag tower** is rectangular in shape, consisting of three overlapping floors, gradually narrowing from bottom to top, built of solid bricks and stones. Each floor has a walkway and entrance, both for decoration and convenient for management and protection. 

* **Flag pole** is located on the top of the highest floor, made of large ironwood (later replaced by steel), about 37 meters high. On the pole hangs the national flag, during the day it is the yellow flag of the Nguyen Dynasty, currently it is the red flag with a yellow star. 

Historically, **Ky Dai** was not only a place to hang flags to announce events, festivals, or military signals, but also a strategic position to observe the entire Hue Citadel and surrounding areas. During the resistance war, this place witnessed many battles for control of the flag.

Today, Ky Dai is a prominent highlight in the complex of Hue Monuments, often appearing in souvenir photos of tourists, especially sparkling when lit up at night."

Built in 1807 under Gia Long's reign, Ky Dai has undergone many restorations but still retains its majesty and grandeur.

The three floors of the podium are stacked on top of each other with bricks, a total of about 17.5 meters high, and above is a soaring flagpole. Standing from here, I can see the large square in front of me, and in the distance is the gently winding Perfume River. If you go in the cool afternoon, you can stroll around the Citadel while admiring Ky Dai in the sunset, a scene that is both ancient and romantic.

What I like is that the surrounding area is quite clean, open space, easy to take virtual photos. However, you should prepare a hat or umbrella if you go during the day because it is quite sunny, and buy tickets to visit the Citadel to explore many other historical buildings. To me, Ky Dai is not only a relic, but also a living testament to the history and culture of the ancient capital."
